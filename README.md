## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Download Fails**
   ```bash
   # Clear HuggingFace cache
   rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/
   pip install --upgrade sentence-transformers
   ```

2. **Memory Issues with Semantic Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Use Enhanced Analysis for resource-constrained environments
   # Or increase system RAM to 4GB+
   ```

3. **PDF Processing Errors**
   ```bash
   # Ensure PDF is not password-protected
   # Try re-saving PDF from original source
   ```
