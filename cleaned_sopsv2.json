to define the information security policy of the  State of Tennessee along with the organization and framework structure required to  communicate, implement, and support this policy.\nInformation is an asset, which like  any other asset owned by the State of Tennessee, has significant value to the  stakeholders of the State.\nInformation security is a critical component that is required  to enable and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, network and  processing resources required for the State of Tennessee to perform its business and  operational practices.\nThis policy document has been created to establish and uphold  the minimum requirements that are necessary to protect Information Technology (IT)  resources (assets) against unavailability, unauthorized or unintentional access,  modification, destruction, or disclosure as set forth by the Information Systems  Council (ISC) of the State of Tennessee.\nThe scope of this document is intended to cover any information asset owned, leased,  or controlled by, or operated on behalf of the State of Tennessee.\nThe methodologies  and practices of external entities that require access to the State of Tennessee s IT  resources may be impacted and could be included in this scope.\nThis document  seeks to protect:    All desktop computing systems, servers, data storage devices, communication  systems, firewalls, routers, switches, and mobile devices (computing platforms)  owned by the State of Tennessee where lawfully permitted.\nAll computing platforms, operating system software, middleware, or application  software under the control of third parties that connect in any way to the State  of Tennessee s enterprise computing or telecommunications network.\nAll data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases, or  other information resource stored on the State of Tennessee s computing  platforms and or transferred by the State s enterprise network.\nAll data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases, or  other information resource stored on contractor computing platforms and or  transferred over contractor network infrastructure.\nThis document applies to all full- and part-time employees of the State of Tennessee,  all third parties, outsourced employees or vendors who work on State premises or  remotely connect their computing platforms to the State of Tennessee s computing  platforms and any cloud provider storing, processing, or transmitting State data.\nBy establishing the appropriate policy framework and utilizing a documented policy  development process that includes all stakeholders, the State envisions maximum  voluntary compliance.\nThe policy development and implementation process includes  an impact analysis, input from Agency IT professionals and approval by the Chief  Information Security Officer (CISO) and Policy Review Committee within Strategic  Technology Solutions (STS), Department of Finance and Administration.\n2    All IT resources and any information system owned by the State of Tennessee should  be protected from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification or destruction in a  manner commensurate with their value, sensitivity and criticality to the business and  operation of the State government and those they serve.\nAccess to information  technology assets will be granted using the principle of least privilege which restricts  the access privileges of authorized individuals to the minimum necessary to perform  their role.\nAll approved policies will support the guidelines established by the Information  Systems Council of the State of Tennessee.\nINTRODUCTION      The Information Security Challenge    IT solutions are driven by the demands of our daily business activities.\nThe ability to  procure efficient communication, IT resources and technologies that support business  processes at a low cost is a foundational component of successful IT programs.\nCloud technologies and offerings continue to grow, and this integration moves quickly  to align itself with the  just in time  requirements of the business.\nGiven the growth  demands of the business along with the associated time sensitive integration  strategies, we are presented with new risks at every turn.\nOrganizations will  frequently take risks in order to meet those time sensitive business requirements,  sometimes bypassing existing processes to meet time demands of the customers  whom they serve.\nAs the State expands its use of cloud technologies, it is incumbent  upon the State to ensure the State data that is hosted or processed in cloud  environments or is transmitted across cloud infrastructure receives protection similar  to what is provided by the STS managed data centers and infrastructure.\nThis  practice, also known as risk management, is a component of any successful  business.\nModern enterprises will implement risk management and or information  security programs to mitigate these risks.\nThe State of Tennessee has recognized the need to evaluate risk and has established  information security programs.\nOne of the main goals of any successful information  security program is to protect the organization s revenues, resources, and reputation.\nThis is accomplished through several means.\nSome examples are implementing risk  management methodologies, security architectures, control frameworks and security  policy.\nSecurity policies are a foundational component of any successful security program.\nThe Enterprise Information Security Policy for the State of Tennessee is based on the  International Standards Organization (ISO) 27000 series standard framework.\nThis  policy is designed to comply with applicable statutes and regulations; however, if  there is a conflict, applicable statutes and regulations will take precedence.\nThis  policy defines the minimum requirements for providing a secure operational  environment.\n4    Scope (2.1)    The scope of this document is intended to cover any information asset owned,  leased or controlled by the State of Tennessee and the methodologies and  practices of the State of Tennessee as well as external entities that require access  to the State of Tennessee s IT resources.\nThis document seeks to protect:    All desktop computing systems, servers, data storage devices,  communication systems, firewalls, routers, switches and mobile devices  (computing platforms) controlled by or operated on behalf of the State of  Tennessee where lawfully permitted.\nAll computing platforms, operating system software, middleware or  application software under the control of the State of Tennessee, or by third  parties, operated on behalf of the State of Tennessee that connect in any  way to the State s enterprise computing or telecommunications network or  any State Cloud Tenant.\nAll data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases or  other information resource stored on the State of Tennessee s computing  platforms and or transferred by the State s enterprise network.\nAll data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases or  other information resource stored on contractor computing platforms and or  transferred over contractor network infrastructure.\nAll full- and part-time employees of the State of Tennessee, all third parties,  outsourced employees, or vendors who work on state premises or remotely  connect their computing platforms to the State of Tennessee s computing  platforms and any cloud provider storing, processing or transmitting State data  should adhere to the policies and requirements set forth in this document.\nAuthority (2.2)    The ISC authorized the Department of Finance and Administration, STS to  establish and enforce enterprise policies and standards related to information  security.\nThese policies and standards include, but are not limited to, network and  Internet access, any computing platform attached to the State s enterprise network  and any wired or wireless technology attached to the State s enterprise network.\nSTS is responsible and authorized by the ISC to perform audits on any device that  attaches to the State of Tennessee s enterprise network.\n5    References:    Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 4-3-5501, et seq., effective April 4,

Sensitive or critical official information, whether physical or electronic  should be properly secured (ideally in a safe or cabinet or other forms of  security furniture) when not required, especially when the office is  vacated.\nComputers and terminals should be logged off or protected with a screen  and keyboard locking mechanism controlled by a password, token, or  similar user authentication mechanism when not in use.\nEnsuring uninterrupted power supply as frequent and sudden power  outages or fluctuations can lead to motherboard crashes and may lead  to data corruption.\nPower backup system such as UPS shall be installed.\nk. When using mobile devices, special care should be taken to ensure that  business information is not compromised.\nl. Password management systems should be interactive and should  ensure secure passwords.\nm. To protect the organization s interests as part of the process of changing  or terminating employment, the communication of termination  responsibilities should include on-going information, cyber security  requirements and legal responsibilities and, where appropriate,  responsibilities contained within any confidentiality agreement.\nn. Operating procedures shall be documented and made available to all  users who need them.\nDocumented procedures shall be prepared for  operational activities associated with information processing and  communication facilities, such as computer start-up and close-down  procedures, backup, media handling, and mail handling management.\nPage 20 of 25    o.\nAll storage media shall be verified to ensure that any sensitive data and  licensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to  disposal or re-use.\np. The date and time of entry and departure of visitors shall be recorded,  and supervised.\nAn information and cyber security awareness program shall be held  regularly to make employees aware of their responsibilities and the  means by which those responsibilities are discharged.\nInformation and cyber security aspects of Business Continuity Management      18.1 Business Continuity Management (BCM)    BCM is a management process that identifies risk, threats and vulnerabilities that could  impact an entity s continued operations and provides a framework for building  organizational resilience and the capability for an effective response.\nBusiness  continuity plan sets out in detail as to how a particular strategy will be implemented in  order to meet the defined requirements.\nThe information and cyber security continuity shall be embedded in the organization s  business continuity management systems.\na. NPS Trust shall determine its requirements for information and cyber security  and the continuity of information and cyber security management in adverse  situations   i.e., during a crisis or disaster.\nb. NPS Trust shall establish, document, implement and maintain processes,  procedures, and controls to ensure the required level of continuity for  information and cyber security during adverse situations.\nc. NPS Trust shall verify the established and implemented information and cyber  security continuity controls at regular intervals in order to ensure that they are  valid and effective during adverse situations.\nPage 21 of 25    18.2 Redundancies    Information-processing facilities shall be implemented with redundancy sufficient to  meet availability requirements.\n18.3 Business Continuity Plan (BCP)      18.3.1 NPS Trust shall establish documented procedures in order to respond,  recover, resume, and restore to a pre-defined level of operation following disruption.\nThe plan shall ensure that employees and assets are protected and are able to restore  function quickly in the event of a disaster.\nIt shall be conceived in advance and involve  input from key stakeholders and employees.\nBCP shall define all risks that can affect  the organization s operations, making it an important part of the organization s risk  management strategy.\nRisks may include natural disasters fire, flood, or weather-  related events and cyber-attacks.\nThe plan shall include:    a.\nDetermining how those risks will affect operations;  b.\nImplementing safeguards and procedures to mitigate the risks;  c. Testing procedures to ensure they work; and  d. Reviewing the process to make sure that it is up to date.\nBCPs are different from a disaster recovery plan, which focuses on the recovery of a  company s IT system after a crisis.\nDeveloping a Business Continuity Plan  Steps to develop BCP shall include:  a.\nBusiness Impact Analysis: Identify functions and related resources that are  time-sensitive.\nRecovery: Identify and implement steps to recover critical business functions.\nPage 22 of 25    c. Organization: Creation of team to focus on business continuity.\nThis team shall  devise a plan to manage the disruption.\nd. Training: The team shall be trained and tested.\nMembers of the team should also  complete practicing exercises associated with BCP.\nNPS Trust shall keep a checklist to include key details such as emergency contact  information, a list of resources the business continuity team may need, where the  backup data and other required information is housed or stored, and other important  personnel details.\nAlong with testing the business continuity team, the NPS Trust shall  also test the BCP itself.\nIt shall be tested several times to ensure it can be applied to  many different risk scenarios.\nThis will help identify any weaknesses in the plan which  can then be identified and corrected.\nAsset management      19.1 Responsibility for assets:      NPS Trust shall identify the organizational assets and define appropriate protection  responsibilities.\nAssets associated with information and information processing facilities shall  be identified and an inventory of these assets shall be drawn up and  maintained.\nRules for the acceptable use of information and of assets associated with  information and information processing facilities shall be identified, documented  ,and implemented.\nc. All employees and external party users shall return all organizational assets in  their possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement.\nPage 23 of 25    19.2  Information classification:      a.\nInformation shall be classified in terms of legal requirements, value, criticality  and sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure or modification.\nAn appropriate set of procedures for information labelling shall be developed  and implemented in accordance with the information classification scheme  adopted by the organization.\nc. Procedures for handling assets shall be developed and implemented in  accordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the  organization.\nAccess control      An access control policy shall be established, documented, and reviewed based on  business, information, and cyber security requirements.\nUsers shall only be provided with access to the network and network services  that they have been specifically authorized to use.\nA formal user registration and de-registration process shall be implemented to  enable assignment of access rights.\nc. A formal user access provisioning process shall be implemented to assign or  revoke access rights for all user types to all systems and services.\nd. The allocation and use of privileged access rights shall be restricted and  controlled.\nThe allocation of secret authentication information shall be  controlled through a formal management process.\nPage 24 of 25    e. The access rights of all employees and external party users to information and  information processing facilities shall be removed upon termination of their  employment, contract, or agreement, or adjusted upon change.\nf. Users shall be made accountable for safeguarding their authentication  information.\ng. Access to information and application system functions shall be restricted in  accordance with the access control policy.\nh. Password management systems shall be interactive and shall ensure secure  passwords.\nCompliance      NPS Trust shall avoid breaches of legal, statutory, regulatory, or contractual  obligations related to information and cyber security and of any security requirements.\nConclusion      Information and cyber security policy is a foundation of a good security program for  any organization.\nInformation and cyber security shall be achieved by implementing a  suitable set of controls, including policies, processes, procedures, organizational  structures and software   hardware functions.\nThese controls need to be established,  implemented, monitored, reviewed, and improved on a continuous basis to ensure that  the specific security and business objectives of the organization are met.\nNPS Trust  shall take a holistic and coordinated view of the organization s information and cyber  security risks in order to implement a comprehensive suite of information and cyber  security controls under the overall framework of a coherent management system.\nThe information and cyber security policy can be effective only if employees adhere to  it.\nIdentifying appropriate controls requires careful planning and attention to detail.\nA  Page 25 of 25    successful information and cyber security policy requires support from all employees  in the organization, participation from stakeholders, suppliers, and specialists advisors.\nSuccessful implementation of the policy would help the organization to report cyber  incidents proactively and minimize and contain the damage.\nThe continuous  surveillance would arm the existing capabilities of information and cyber security  framework leading to development of an effective and robust security thereby ensuring  that the organization s assets are reasonably safe and protected against any cyber  threats.\nThis policy shall be operationalized by way of detailed standard operating procedures  (SOPs)  and internal circulars and plans of action at various levels of the organization  as may be appropriate, to address the challenging requirement of information and  cyber security."

Person-identifying information - any data which relates to a living individual who can be  identified from that data, or from that data in conjunction with other readily available  information.\nSpecial category and criminal conviction personal data (previously known as Sensitive  Personal Data):  a sub-category of personal data that could cause harm or distress to an  identifiable individual if generally released, including information relating to an individual s:     Racial or ethnic origin     Political opinions     Religious or philosophical beliefs     Trade union membership     Genetic data     Biometric data (where used for identification)     Health     Sex life or sexual orientation     Criminal convictions and offences    Additional conditions and safeguards must be applied to ensure that special category and  criminal conviction personal data is handled appropriately by the University and is treated as  Highly Restricted information.\nThe University also recognises other personal data besides  special category data as Highly Restricted information.\nOther examples can be found here.\nThis Procedure applies to all members of staff, as well as individuals conducting work at or  for the University and or its subsidiaries, who are duly authorised to have access to  University IT facilities ( staff ).\nThis includes temporary, honorary, visiting, casual, voluntary  and agency workers, students employed by the University and suppliers (this list is not  intended to be exhaustive).\nThis Procedure also applies to students who have access to  information classified as Very Sensitive, Highly Restricted or Restricted or critical systems,  related to the conduct of University matters, such as University-led research.\nNB   Where the incident relates to the loss or potential loss of payment card data, then  the process as outlined in the PCI DSS Incident Response Management SOP must be  followed.\n3 of 8  Directorate of Compliance and Risk  June 2022    3  Procedure and responsibilities    3.1  Consequences of non-compliance with this Procedure    Compliance with this Procedure is mandatory and non-compliance must be reported to the  Head of Information Governance who will determine the action to be taken.\nStaff must note that any breach of this Procedure may be treated as misconduct under the  University s relevant disciplinary procedures and could lead to disciplinary action.\n3.2  Report and contain potential harm    All information security incidents must be reported to the Information Governance Office  ( IGO ) as a matter of urgency and if the incident involves Very Sensitive or Highly Restricted  Information, such as special category or criminal conviction personal data or a large volume  of person-identifying information, you must contact the IGO immediately.\nThis is so that the  seriousness of the incident can be assessed as soon as possible and advice can be provided  on any immediate containment action required to minimise the impact.\nInformation Governance Office Tel: 0161 275 7789 or email:  infosec listserv.manchester.ac.uk    Staff must not attempt to manage information security incidents themselves.\nThis includes  both positive and negative actions: do not attempt to modify, limit or contain the extent of  the incident unless explicitly instructed to do so by the IGO.\nWhere an incident occurs outside office hours and the incident involves actual or  immediately threatened harm to individuals, contact the Security Office who will inform the  Emergency Incident Manager on your behalf.\nSecurity Office Tel 0161 306 9966 (the number is on the back of all staff student ID cards    If in doubt, it is better to report a suspected incident than to ignore it.\n3.3  Investigate and assess risks    3.3.1  Information gathering    Staff must co-operate promptly with the IGO to gather information relating to the scope of  the incident.\nThis includes completing the incident report as quickly as possible.\nIf it is concluded that a serious or complex incident has occurred, an Information Security  Incident Response Team may be set up,

Companies    Page 6 of 41  1.\nIntroduction  Godrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies (GILAC) intends to follow process-based approach to  design, implement, improve and maintain information security across all group companies.\nGILAC looks  at information security as a strategic issue and has therefore set up a Group Chief Information Security  Officer (CISO) role to be primarily responsible for implementing and monitoring the GILAC s information  security policies   processes.\nThis entails creation of a framework which will govern the entire information  security

employment.\nHUTCHMED  NFORMAT ON SECUR TY POL CY        Page 13 of 16    Appendix 1: Guidelines on Data Classi cation and Labeling    1.\nData Classi cation  All information should be classified according to its level of sensitivity.\nFive default categories  are suggested.\nThey are:       Public      nternal Use     Departmental     Confidential     Highly confidential    These classifications have been designed to protect information from unauthorized disclosure,  use, modification or deletion, based on  need to know  policy, i.e.\naccess to corporate  information shall be restricted with the e ect that only those who have an evident business  reason to access the information shall be granted access.\nnformation which is not specifically classified should be scrutinized to ascertain the  classification, and if this cannot be done then the information should by default be deemed to  be classified as  nternal Use, and therefore should be treated accordingly.\nn this appendix:       An access control list for a piece of information is a list of persons or parties authorized to  have the right to access the information,     A distribution list is a list of persons or parties to which a piece of information is physically  distributed.\n1.1  Public   Public  classification applies to information that has been explicitly approved by the  management of the relevant business entity for disclosure to the public outside of the  HUTCHMED Group.\nHUTCHMED  NFORMAT ON SECUR TY POL CY        Page 14 of 16       Only designated persons may classify information as Public.\nOnly designated persons may disclose Public information.\nSuch disclosure shall follow  predefined procedures, rules and guidelines.\n1.2  Internal Use    nternal Use  classification applies to information that, if disclosed inadvertently or without  authorization, could have negative consequences for the business unit, the sub-group or  HUTCHMED Group and may induce costs in redressing those consequences.\nnternal Use information shall not be disclosed to anybody outside of the HUTCHMED Group  without prior approval by the  nformation Owner.\nf the  nternal Use information has any access  control list, it shall not be disclosed to any other persons outside such access restriction without  prior approval by the  nformation Owner.\nnternal Use information without an access control  list may be disclosed within the HUTCHMED Group.\nnformation Owner may also impose additional disclosure or handling restrictions to  nternal  Use information.\nAdditional restrictions must not weaken the basic disclosure rules stated in  this document.\n1.3  Departmental   Departmental  information can be freely shared with members of the owning department.\nSharing such information with individuals outside of the owning department requires  authorization by the appropriate  nformation Owner.\n1.4  Con dential   Confidential  classification applies to information that, if disclosed inadvertently or without  authorization, could have significant negative consequences for the business unit, the sub- group or HUTCHMED Group and may induce significant costs in redressing those consequences.\nConfidential information should always have a distribution list or access control list, and should  not be disclosed to any persons outside such distribution list or access control list without prior  approval by the  nformation Owner.\nn the absence of an access control list, the distribution list  is deemed to be the access control list.\nn the absence of both the distribution and access  control lists, Confidential information shall not be disclosed to anybody without prior approval  by the  nformation Owner.\nHUTCHMED  NFORMAT ON SECUR TY POL CY        Page 15 of 16     nformation Owner may also impose additional disclosure or handling restrictions to  Confidential information.\nAdditional restrictions must not weaken the basic disclosure rules  stated in this document.\nn addition, Confidential information must be further protected against deliberate and  inadvertent unauthorized disclosure in its handling, including display, storage, transmission  and disposal.\n1.5  Highly con dential   Highly confidential  information can only be shared on a  need to know  basis with a limited  number of individuals who have been identified by the appropriate  nformation Owner.\nDue to the diversity of HUTCHMED Group business and local legislative, HUTCHMED Group  business units should further take into the account of their business needs, the compliance to  various legislation and industry requirements to set up the desirable categories.\nHowever, the  ultimate categories shall be able to be mapped into the 5 default categories and shall not  violate or contradict to the principles set out in this policy.\nInformation Labeling  Management of business entities is responsible for assessing, designing and implementing  applicable specific procedures for information labeling for their respective business entities.\nHowever, such activity should be justified and supported by the following criteria:    1.  t is required by local legislation, or  2.\nWithout other alternatives, individual labeling is the only way that stakeholders could  aware of the sensitive of the information, and:      t is technically feasible, and      t is economically feasible.\nThat is, the total benefit of such exercise outweighs the  cost including on-going maintenance cost.\nf a business entity does decide to go ahead with labeling, the following rules should apply:     Confidential information should be the first to be labeled.\nThe  nformation Owner is responsible to label the information according to its  classification.\nHUTCHMED  NFORMAT ON SECUR TY POL CY        Page 16 of 16       Only the  nformation Owner or a person designated by the  nformation Owner should be  authorized to change the classification label on information.\nThe classification label should be readily apparent.\nThe access control list and any additional restrictions should be clearly stated on the  classification label or otherwise be readily apparent.\nFor

Accountable Owners: Business   Data Owners  All information must have a clearly defined owner or custodian   called a Business or Data  Owner.\nThe Business Owner is usually the senior person responsible and accountable for  the function that creates and uses that information from creation to consumption and end  of use (e.g., Dean, Head of Department, Principal Investigator, Research   Academic  Supervisor, Manager, etc.).\nThe Data Owner may be at any level in the organisation   a  small team or even a sole researcher, with responsibility for protecting the information they  have been entrusted with.\nFor consistency of scope, the term Data Owner will be used in this policy.\nThe Data Owner is responsible for putting rules and processes in place around access,  use, quality and accuracy, storage and security, and ensuring compliance with those  documented rules.\nData ownership also applies to each individual user who stores and  processes university information and is responsible for protecting it.\nAsset Registers  Data Owners must know what data, infrastructure, IT equipment, information and IT  systems, software, cloud services, and storage they use.\nThis is key to defining  Departmental Business Continuity Plans.\nData Owners are responsible for ensuring their data is securely managed regardless of  location i.e., whether in local departmental systems, in IT Services centrally managed  facilities and services or in third party hosted solutions.\nData Owners (or their delegates), whether at a business area, school, department, or  faculty level must maintain and update an Asset Register (See Knowledge Article  University of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 4 of 11  Information Security).\nData Owners should notify IT Services, of new devices or systems  before they are procured and connected.\nThis is to ensure end user devices are  appropriately protected and managed (See IT Services  Computer Security), and to  ensure the Data  System Owner carries out appropriate assessment and security checks.\nSee Section 3.2 Assess the risks.\nIT Services maintain an asset register of centrally managed applications, systems and  services as recorded in the IT Service catalogue.\nC.  System Owner  Administrator  System Owners  Administrators are nominated roles: in charge of and responsible for  managing the systems which provide the service.\nThis role is sometimes also referred to  as Data Steward.\ni.  Centrally managed IT facilities  The IT Services Department (IT Services) is the System Owner for the university s  centrally managed IT facilities, storage, systems, services, and infrastructure ( IT  facilities and services ) that underpin university information assets.\nIT Services  staff, as system owners  administrators for named systems, will work in  collaboration with the Data Owner to manage and protect the information.\nSee  Section 3.3 Protect.\nSystem owner  administrator for non-centrally managed IT facilities  If university departments have established local information systems which are not  centrally managed or supported, the Data Owner, and their nominated system  owners  administrators must manage these facilities to the same minimum-security  baseline standards as IT Services.\nSee Section 3.3 Protect.\nD.  Users and Acceptable Use   The university IT Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) (See Related Documentation) outlines  expected behaviours that all Users of IT facilities and services (students, staff,  researchers, honorary members, and third parties carrying out a university function) must  comply with.\nThe AUP includes rules for the acceptable and prohibited use of university IT  facilities and services, including responsibility for protecting University information.\nIt links  to relevant misconduct and or disciplinary policies in the event of misuse.\nE.  Training and Awareness  The university is committed to supporting and promoting staff awareness of their  information security responsibilities through a framework of policies, guidance, webpages,  team briefings, staff obligatory e-learning and cyber security awareness training.\nTraining should be appropriate to role.\nFor example, system owners  administrators with  privileged access, or business areas who regularly handle high risk information, should  undertake appropriate training, and adhere to documented operating procedures.\nData  owners, as part of their Faculty and Department structure and responsibilities for  protecting university information, are responsible for organising relevant training within  their business area to enable staff to protect university information and infrastructure.\nUniversity of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 5 of 11  3.2  Assess the risks  When planning to procure or develop new information systems, IT facilities and services  data and system owners should give as much advance notice as possible to relevant  central professional services departments (including, but not limited to: IT Services, Legal,  Finance and Procurement).\nThis is to:    ensure effective use of university resources (financial, infrastructure and workforce).\nprioritise workload against existing demands.\nensure the system meets the minimum-security baseline (see section 3.3) and  enterprise architecture principles    assess the impact, and integration with current university systems.\nassess and build in data protection privacy and transparency requirements.\nThis Information Security Policy supports Data Owners and System Owners to carry out  an appropriate assessment by signposting relevant processes and templates.\nSee  Knowledge Article Information Security for an overview of key information risk assessment  processes.\nWhere baseline requirements cannot be met, an exception to the minimum-security  baseline should be raised.\nAlthough this exception will be assessed and recorded by IT  Services, it is the data owner  system owner responsibility to own and mitigate the risks.\nData Classification: Assessing and classifying information using the Data classification  Scheme (Figure 1 below) focuses effort and resources into identifying and protecting the  most sensitive and valuable information.\nFigure 1 below summarises the three data  classifications which underpin this Information Security Policy.\nPublic  Internal  Confidential  Information intended  for sharing in the  public domain  Information used for day- to-day University functions  not for general public  Default classification  Any quantity of Personal data (about  living people) or information with  contractual, business or research  value  Impact if breached:  No adverse impact  Impact if breached:  Some adverse impact and  disruption to services.\nPossible breach of  confidence or statutory  duty  Impact if breached:  Serious privacy or reputational risk,  financial impact, commercial  disadvantage or disruption to services  Breach of statutory   regulatory duty    risk of fine  Information  categorised as  PUBLIC does not need  any special handling  requirements.\nAccess should be  appropriate to role and is  protected by min.\none  barrier e.g., username and  password for technical  security.\nID access control  Access should be: appropriate to role  and authorised by the Data  Business  Owner; protected with more than one  barrier; encrypted when in transit;  shared only with appropriate  University of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 6 of 11  Public  Internal  Confidential  or locked office   cupboard  for physical security.\nUse centrally managed IT  facilities (approved cloud  and University premises)  personnel; securely destroyed at end  of use.\nUse centrally managed IT facilities  and services (on university  premises and approved Cloud)  incl.\nfull disk encryption on all  mobile storage devices  The higher the risk of compromise, the more layers of protection (physical, technical,  personnel and procedural security) are necessary to secure it.\nThe Information Protection  Guide outlines how the university expects different aspects of data classification and  protection measures to be applied (from creation through to disposition) by all Users of  university information.\n3.3  Protect  IT Services provide and are responsible for ensuring centrally managed IT facilities and  services meet external security standards, self-assessments, audits, and other regulatory  frameworks.\nData  system owners are responsible for adhering to the same standards for  any locally procured or legacy systems.\nSecurity standards are a pre-requisite for organisations to collaborate on research, obtain  funding or to obtain and use partner organisation s data.\nThe standards and certifications  include (but are not limited to): NCSC Cyber Essentials, NHS Data Security   Protection  Toolkit, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Web Accessibility  Standard WCAG2.2 AA  EN 301 549 and Cyber Security audit.\nProtection measures and  standards are reflected within the University across 4 main aspects:  A.  Minimum-security baseline  The minimum-security baseline is a requirement across all university IT facilities and  services, to comply with information and cyber security requirements as well as external  security certifications.\nA programme of work is underway within IT Services to mitigate  risks within centrally managed legacy systems to meet the minimum-security baseline or  update to compliant solutions.\nProposals to buy new or to upgrade existing IT facilities and services must be submitted to  IT services for assessment and approval.\nThe Supplier Security Questionnaire (SSQ)  provides security due diligence on a supplier and their solution  service to operate in a  secure manner before entrusting the supplier with university data.\nThis SSQ process helps  departments to minimise and manage risk to their data and to the university infrastructure  and reputation.\nSee Knowledge Article Information Security for steps to initiate a Supplier Security  Questionnaire (items 1-3).\nThe table below lists the minimum-security baseline and secure  design requirements.\nUniversity of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 7 of 11  Minimum-security baseline   Authentication  and account  management  All systems must be protected with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  All systems must be protected with the university central IT account  management (IT Services Single Sign On (SSO))  Supplier should have clearly defined account management  procedures for own staff and their third parties: authentication and  authorisation; and technical security measures to prevent a malicious  or compromised user in the Supplier environment from affecting the  data or service   Activity logging  Audit trail of user and system actions and events to provide  traceability of the use of a service  Vulnerability  management  Systems and infrastructure are underpinned by operating system and  software applications which need to be checked (scanned) and fixed  (patched) to reduce vulnerability to cyber-attack.\nSupplier should have an active vulnerability and patch management  procedure and be able to apply patches for critical and high severity  vulnerabilities in line with Cyber Essentials requirements.\nAntimalware  protection  All IT systems, cloud services, and computing devices (infrastructure  and endpoint) must have antimalware protection.\nEncryption  University data should be protected in transit (transmitted across the  internet - at least TLS1.2) and at rest (AES256).\nDesign  Technologies  Technologies, protocols and web browsers etc should be actively  maintained and be supported (i.e.\nreceiving updates and patches).\nDesign    Integrations  Data flow and integrations with existing systems should be clearly  defined and secured.\nWill be subject to assessment by IT Services  Enterprise Architects.\nBack Up,  Resilience and  Availability  Regularly taking backups of data, testing restores and having detailed  assurances about the resilience and availability of a system is  essential.\nSupplier to provide information about their back-up solution,  disaster recovery process and service   support package.\nDepartment Business Continuity Plans should incorporate back up  resilience and availability of locally managed systems.\nNetwork  connectivity  Only necessary network services to be accessed from the internet to  reduce exposure to attack.\nIT Services to assess and approve.\nConfiguration of  equipment   Computers and network devices should be configured to reduce  vulnerabilities and provide only the services required to fulfil their role.\nSee also Infrastructure Management Code of Practice and Shared  Responsibility Matrix  University of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 8 of 11  B.\nInformation Handover and End of Use  All university information should be returned to the university when users leave or move to  another role (i.e., staff, researchers, students, honorary members, and third parties  carrying out a university function).\nThis includes informing appropriate staff of information  handover arrangements to ensure the university retains ownership and custody of the  information.\nAll members of the university should comply with the University Retention Schedule for  end of use secure disposal or preservation of information.\nInternal and Confidential  information should be  destroyed beyond the ability to recover it  (paying due regard to  environmental and legislative requirements around waste and hazardous waste  processing).\nSecure disposal arrangements for data bearing IT equipment and sensitive  paper waste are subject to contracts and documented procedures.\nThis is to manage the  chain of custody; securely erase or destroy the data; and provide destruction certification  from the third party services.\no IT Services has a contract with a third-party IT Asset Disposal Partner for  secure disposal of all data bearing IT equipment.\nInformation remains on IT  equipment even when a user has deleted the file, therefore secure erasure,  and disposal of IT equipment via the IT Services contracted service is  mandatory.\nDonating university computing equipment or removing data  storage from computing devices are not secure destruction methods and  constitute a breach of University Policy.\nIt is each Department s and School s  responsibility to ensure all data bearing IT equipment and end user devices  are collected and securely erased by the contracted IT Asset Disposal  Partner.\nhttps:  www.liverpool.ac.uk it my-computer disposal   o IT Services (Information   Records Management team) provide  appropriate facilities enabling staff to carry out secure disposal of sensitive  paper waste via secure locked consoles or confidential waste bags (which  are collected and shredded by a third-party contractor).\nContact Information    Records Management for advice on disposal of non-paper confidential  waste e.g., USBs and CDs.\nhttps:  www.liverpool.ac.uk it records- management storage-and-disposal confidential-waste   C.  Incident Reporting:  All Users of university information, IT facilities and services are responsible for reporting  data loss and security incidents.\nReport a loss or compromise of personal data immediately to the university Data  Protection Officer.\nSee https:  www.liverpool.ac.uk intranet legal data-protection-foi- staff data-breach  Ensure your Line Manager is also aware.\nContact IT Services Service Desk immediately https:  www.liverpool.ac.uk it getting- help .via Phone:  44 (0)151 794 4567.\nD.  Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT):  University of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 9 of 11  The CSIRT is a cross functional team of IT Services staff, with support from Legal    Governance staff, who respond to IT security incidents and policy breaches, associated IT  Investigation requests, activity, and vulnerability reporting.\nA core function of the CSIRT is to effectively investigate the cause(s) of an IT security  incident and implement measures to recover and to mitigate risk to the university.\nThe CSIRT may pass information relating to an IT security incident or breach to external  organisations for information or further action.\nThese may include (but are not limited to)  the Information Commissioner s Office (ICO), the Police or other Statutory bodies.\n3.4  Govern and review  A security governance framework is not just policy compliance.\nIt is about embedding  responsibility for information across all aspects of university work.\nEnabling the culture that  recognises the value and importance of data, how it underpins our business goals, and  how it supports all aspects of university research, teaching and learning, professional  services, and wider collaboration.\nThis Information Security Policy is part of the foundations supporting the university to  control, direct and communicate cyber security risk management activities, through a  Cyber Security Awareness, Behaviour and Culture (ABC) programme.\nInformation Governance Committee  The remit of the Information Governance Committee (which reports to Formal Senior  Leadership Team and risk oversight to Audit Committee) helps to set direction and be  accountable for information governance related policies and management arrangements to  ensure they are compatible with the strategic direction of the organisation: handling and  protecting information throughout its lifecycle.\nThis includes monitoring compliance with  Information Governance related policies and oversight of information risk management.\nBusiness Continuity  The University Business Continuity Policy is overseen by the Property   Campus Services  Department, with contributions from all relevant areas of the university.\nAll Schools and  Departments should maintain, review, and test their local IT Business Continuity Plans  (BCPs) to integrate with the University approach.\nPayment Card Data Security  The university has an established PCI steering group which oversees the teams managing  all payment card processing (and cardholder information) across the university.\nThe  Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Finance Policy sets out the  rules for protecting the security of all card payments received and processed by the  University.\nOperating Procedures and documentation  Senior Management Teams should oversee and validate that procedures are in place e.g.\nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\nData and System Owners should ensure they  have implemented relevant controls: responsibilities, risk assessment, protection, and  governance measures as outlined in this Information Security Policy.\nUniversity of Liverpool      Information Security Policy V5.2  Page 10 of 11  3.0 Policy Compliance  Failure to comply with this Policy and the supporting Information Protection Guide in  protecting university information (or that entrusted to us by a third party) puts the university  at risk of reputational damage, financial penalty, breach of legal, contractual or regulatory  requirement.\nIt may also lead to disciplinary action in accordance with the relevant  Disciplinary Policy (staff or student) or misconduct investigation in accordance with  relevant Misconduct Policy.\n4.0 Related Documentation  This section lists directly relevant guidance and policies that have been referenced within  this Information Security Policy.\nThis policy is subject to annual review which includes a  check that hyperlinks within the document

Certification (CMMC) Domains The current version of the CMMC framework consists of a matrix, composed of  Domains,   Capabilities,  and  Practices and Processes.\nThe model contains 18 different Domains of  key sets of capabilities for cybersecurity,  14 of which use the same terminology as the security requirement families in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171.\nChief Information Officer   CMMC (defense.gov) HIPAA Security Rule Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - NIST SP 800-66 HIPAA Security Rule NIST International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27001 ISO - International Organization for Standardization ISO IEC 27001 is an internationally recognized security standard that formally specifies an Information Security Management System (ISMS) that is intended to bring information security under explicit management control.\nAs a formal specification, it mandates requirements that define how to implement, monitor, maintain, and continually improve the ISMS.\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  SP 800-53 NIST SP 800-53 database represents the controls defined in NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations.\nNIST SP 800-53r 5 Control Families Roles and Responsibilities Define key roles and responsibilities to complete a task.\nRoles Responsibility All RTI Staff Comply with requirements set forth in this policy; acknowledge read and understand training.\nRTI Vendors and Contractors Comply with requirements set forth in this policy; acknowledge read and

technologies.\nChief Information Security Officer (CISO) The Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is the executive responsible for an organization s information and data security.\nOffice of the CISO The Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) staff serve in a segregated role and are responsible for keeping up to date on the latest IT compliance practices and regulatory requirements.\nThe OCISO Managers and staff will assist to ensure that all network, digital and information technology related activities of RTI and its Page 1 of 18 staff are conducted in agreement with RTI, the ISMS and IT Policies, Procedures and regulatory security compliance practices and standards.\nGlobal Technology Solutions (GTS) Responsible for the governance of RTI s network, maintenance of the infrastructure, and functionality of Corporate systems.\nDefinitions Term Acronym Definition Document Management System (DMS) A system used to retrieve, track, manage and store documents.\nInformation Security Management System (ISMS) A set of policies concerned with information security management or IT related risks.\nIntroduction This comprehensive Information Security Policy (ISP) provides information on the RTI   IT prescribed measures used to establish and mandate the IT security program for compliance to both internal and external data protection requirements.\nInformation Security is everyone s responsibility and to ensure an effective security position is a team effort involving the participation and support of every RTI system user who interacts with data and information systems.\nTherefore, it is the responsibility of every user to know this policy and to conduct their activities accordingly.\nProtecting company information and the systems that collect, process, and store this information is of critical importance.\nConsequently, the security of information systems must include controls and safeguards to offset possible threats and vulnerabilities, as well as controls to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data:   Confidentiality   Confidentiality addresses preserving restrictions on information access and disclosure so that access is restricted to only authorized users and services.\nIntegrity   Integrity addresses the concern that sensitive data has not been modified or deleted in an unauthorized and undetected manner.\nAvailability   Availability addresses ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.\nSecurity measures must be taken to guard against unauthorized access to, alteration, disclosure or destruction of data and information systems.\nPurpose The purpose of this policy is to highlight the company and regulatory requirements under which RTI staff shall operate and safeguard its data and information systems to both reduce risk and minimize the effect of potential incidents.\nImplementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) and consistent security controls within RTI helps the institute comply with obligations to ensure long term due diligence in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of RTI and client data.\nThis policy summarizes the comprehensive framework for:   Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of RTI s data and related information systems.\nProtecting RTI, its employees, and its clients from unauthorized use of RTI owned and or managed information systems and data.\nPage 2 of 18   Ensuring the effectiveness of security controls over data and information systems owned and or managed by RTI that support the Institute s operations.\nRecognizing the highly networked nature of the current computing environment and provide effective management and oversight of Information Security risks.\nScope This policy applies to all RTI employees, vendors, contractors, sub-contractors, as well as all RTI-owned or IT Administrator-managed data, information systems, activities, and assets owned, leased, controlled, or used by RTI.\nAny other systems, assets or activities not owned by RTI or maintained by RTI s IT Department, IT Administrator, are not included in this policy.\nGeneral Information Security Controls The RTI security control policies align with the National Institute of Technology (NIST) framework, which is updated accordingly, and have been developed to define a minimum level of security and control across RTI.\nAny unauthorized exceptions to the ISMS and or standards will not be permitted.\nThese standards and the ISMS go into effect upon the initial publication of this document.\nBusiness Units may provide more rigorous security and control solutions and standards beyond what has been required in the RTI 14.1 Network and Computing Security Policy and associated procedures.\nAll employees, contractors, and others who have access to RTI facilities and information assets must be made aware of the ISMS, Acceptable Use, and security policies within 30 days of hire (for employees) or prior to being given such access (for contractors) and at least annually thereafter.\nSecurity responsibilities will be specified in job descriptions, through RTI policies, procedures, and contracts (as applicable), and compliance with RTI Information Security Awareness training will be monitored and enforced by Office of the CISO in coordination with Enterprise Risk Management.\nFor the purposes of this statement, Security Awareness refers to employee s awareness of the Information Security Management Systems (ISMS), Information Security policies, standards, and practices.\nSome network activities shall be monitored and logged to ensure compliance with the rules established in this and other IT policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.\nExternal Regulations Any systems connected to the RTI network or that store RTI or Client data will meet applicable requirements set forth by external regulations.\nSuch regulations may include but are not limited to:   EAR and Export-controlled data   Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)   Validated (GxP) Systems   Title 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Signatures If a client contractual requirement is more stringent than security baseline controls or regulatory mandates implemented at RTI, the contract will take precedence and IT Administrators must be notified of the requirements.\nInformation Security and Classification of Electronic Information All client and enterprise information held by RTI, and information contracted by RTI to be held by third parties, are classified, and protected.\nThe Office of the CISO creates and maintain standards regarding the use and disclosure of client and enterprise electronic information.\nRTI client and enterprise electronic information may only be used and disclosed for RTI business purposes.\nInformation obtained from or on behalf of RTI s clients, vendors or other third parties may be used Page 3 of 18 and disclosed only as permitted by the contracts with, and representations made to those third parties.\nPlease refer to the RTI Policy 14.2 Information Security and Classification of Electronic Information and supporting procedures for the classification and handling of electronic data.\nIT Operations Management Security IT Administrators will create and maintain procedures that support this Policy and designate roles and responsibilities for the secure management and operation of all information processing facilities.\nThis includes the development of appropriate operating instructions.\nIT Administrators will:   Deploy code controls adequate to detect and prevent the introduction of malicious software.\nDeploy controls to adequately protect exchanges of information and software with third parties to ensure the security of the transaction as well as compliance with applicable laws.\nEnact standards to protect information and media in transit as defined in IT standards.\nManage changes to the IT infrastructure to minimize the likelihood of outages and reduce the risk of negatively impacting RTI s IT security posture.\nData protection considerations will be built into information systems and applications.\nThis will include infrastructure, commercial products, and applications either developed internally or via outsourcing and client-facing applications hosted by both RTI and clients.\nAll security requirements will be identified and agreed to during the requirements -setting of a project and documented.\nAppropriate controls and audit trails or activity logs must be designed into application systems including the validation, authorization, and authentication of access controls.\nAdditional controls might be required for systems that process or have an impact on sensitive, valuable, or critical organizational assets.\nIT Administrators will incorporate cryptographic controls, when applicable, to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information.\nIn addition, IT Administrators will provide adequate protections for source code and incorporate technical security testing into development processes, lifecycles, and quality assurance.\nIT Administrators will utilize change control, vulnerability scanning, security development, and testing processes to ensure the security of the system(s) and the operating environment(s) are not compromised.\nIT Administrators will implement and adhere to secure development practices and standards as specified by applicable regulations and law to their line of business.\nLegacy RTI application products that have operationally survived longer than their capability to be sustained with relevant security patches and features to mitigate evolving threats will be sunset or otherwise isolated from RTI s IT infrastructure.\nOffice of the CISO Guidance Section NIST SP 800-53 XX-1 controls, CM-10, AC-3, AU-9, AU-11, CP-9, MP-4, SA-5, SI-12, Appendix J Privacy Controls, SI-12, AC-8,

Identifiable Information(PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) are properly protected.\nAny cryptographic controls are used appropriately according to relevant compliance requirements.\nCompliance with security policies and standards:   At least annually, OCISO (or designated third party) will perform reviews or audits of users  and systems  compliance with the ISMS, security policies, standards, and procedures, and initiate corrective actions where necessary.\nResults from compliance reviews or audits shall be documented and reported by IT SLT.\nInformation system audit considerations:   OCISO implements audit procedures to help ensure that activities involving reviews or audits of operational systems are carefully planned to minimize the risk of disruptions to business processes.\nIT information systems are enabled to generate audit records containing details to help establish what type of event occurred, when and where the event occurred, the source and outcome of the event, and the identity of any individuals or subjects associated with the event.\nPolicy Statements IT Administrators shall design, implement, and maintain a coherent set of standards and procedures to manage risks to data, in an effort to ensure an acceptable level of Information Security risk and alignment with the ISMS.\nThrough these standards and procedures, RTI will protect and ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of all its information systems and data, regardless of how it is created, distributed, or stored.\nSecurity controls will be tailored accordingly so that cost-effective controls can be applied commensurate with the risk and sensitivity of the data and information system.\nSecurity controls must be designed and maintained to ensure compliance with all legal requirements.\nExceptions While every exception to a policy or standard potentially weakens protection mechanisms for RTI information systems and underlying data, occasionally exceptions will exist.\nProcedures for requesting an exception to policies, procedures or standards are available in section Risk Acceptance Approval Process.\nUpdates Updates to the Policy will be announced to employees via management updates or email announcements.\nChanges will be noted in the Record of Changes to highlight the pertinent changes from the previous policies, procedures, and guidelines.\nc. Monitoring IT reserves the right to monitor RTI computer resources and or Users at any time and for any reason (including compliance with this policy).\nAnyone using or accessing a RTI computer

on systems and applications and that individuals understand the responsibility their access level provides them.\nThis policy defines access control standards for system use notices, remote access, and definition and documentation of relationships for information systems.\nIT Administrators will create and maintain standards regarding information access controls.\nThe minimum requirements for user credentials and the management of those credentials, as well as the Physical Access to RTI Data Center and Environmental Standards will be defined in the supporting standard operating procedures.\nPage 6 of 18 Access privileges granted to an individual are for the sole use of that individual and are not to be shared.\nThis includes, privileges granted via card key, username and passwords, keys, tokens, and access to RTI applications, systems, network assets, and resources.\nAll granting of privileges must be controlled through proper approval processes and authentication mechanisms.\nDuties of individuals will be separated to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion.\nIndividual account permissions are not allowed on file shares.\nUpon termination of employment, an employee s or external party s user access rights will be revoked.\nAsset owners must conduct regular reviews of users  access rights and use of accounts.\nUnsuccessful logon attempts will be limited.\nTime and date of logons and account changes will be appropriately recorded and monitored.\nTo prevent access viewing of data after period of inactivity, session lock with pattern-hiding displays are used.\nPassword management systems will be interactive and mandate strong passwords.\nRemote access sessions will be monitored and controlled.\nWireless access will be protected using authentication and encryption.\nConnections to and use of external information systems will be verified, controlled, and limited.\nPolicy:  Awareness and Training (AT) Guidance Section NIST SP 800-171 3.1 NIST SP 800-53 AT-1  Awareness and Training Policy CMMC Domain Awareness and Training ISO 5.2, 5.3, 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.3, A.5.1.1, A.5.1.2, A.6.1.1, A.12.1.1, A.18.1.1, A.18.2.2 The quality and integrity of RTI s Information Security Awareness training ensures that the workforce members, including management of RTI s information systems, understand the ISMS as well as the security implications of their actions and increases the likelihood that information system security will not be breached, either intentionally or unintentionally, through technical measures (such as hacking) or non-technical measures (such as social engineering).\nThe goal is to ensure users understand the risks of using information technology, how to defend against malicious threats, and how to react to information security events or incidents, whether at work or at home.\nWithin thirty days of an employee s or contractor s hire date, the personnel shall receive Information Security Awareness training explaining RTI ISMS, security policies and company expectations regarding those security policies.\nFacilitate the Information Security Awareness training, RTI will utilize the online, RTI Learning Management System (LMS).\nThe LMS course will be the system of record for Information Security Awareness training compliance for all employees and completion is required by all employees and contractors.\nIn addition to the awareness training, each employee contractor will be required to complete specific job-related training as appropriate to their role.\nEach employee or contractor will be required to complete the Information Security Awareness training on an annual basis after their first year.\nPage 7 of 18   The Awareness Training content will be updated annually to address new risks to the organization and may include a separate version for  refresh  training.\nEmployees might be required to complete additional job specific security training on an annual basis depending on their job function.\nThe Awareness and Training Procedures supports the implementation of and compliance with this policy.\nPolicy:  Audit and Accountability (AU) Guidance Section NIST SP 800-171 3.3.1-3.3.9 NIST SP 800-53 AU-1  Audit and Accountability Policy CMMC Domain Audit and Accountability ISO 5.2, 5.3, 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.3, A.5.1.1, A.5.1.2, A.6.1.1, A.12.1.1, A.18.1.1, A.18.2.2 The purpose of the Audit and Accountability Policy is to ensure that major applications and general support systems are evaluated on a continual basis in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, FISMA and other applicable federal, state, and local guidelines.\nThe quality and integrity of RTI s system monitoring and auditing is used to determine if inappropriate actions, either intentional or unintentional, have occurred within an information system.\nSystem monitoring is used to look for these inappropriate actions in real time while system auditing looks for them after the fact.\nWithout system auditing and assigned accountability, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine when a failure of the information system security, or a breach of the information systems itself has occurred, the magnitude of the breach or failure, and the details of that breach or failure.\nEvent audit logs contain system generated audit records that contain information to establish what events occurred on the system, the source(s) of the events, and the outcome of the events.\nIT Administrators will create, protect, and retain information system audit records to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful, unauthorized, or inappropriate information system activity.\nIT Administrators will ensure that the actions of individual information system users can be uniquely traced to those users.\nAudited events will be reviewed and updated.\nIT Administrators will correlate audit review, analysis, and reporting processes for investigation and response to indications of inappropriate, suspicious, or unusual activity.\nAudit information and audit tools will be protected from unauthorized access, modification, and deletion.\nPolicy:  Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring (CA) Guidance Section NIST SP 800-171 3.12.1 3.12.3 NIST SP 800-53 CA-1 Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring Policy CMMC Domain

degree to which information system security controls are correctly implemented, whether they are operating as intended, and whether they are producing the desired level of security.\nVulnerability assessment is focused on determining the weaknesses inherent in the information systems that could be exploited, leading to an information system breach.\nWithout security and vulnerability assessments, the potential exists that information systems may not be as secure as intended or desired.\nPage 8 of 18   Periodically assess the security controls in organizational information systems to determine if the controls are effective in their application.\nDevelop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or eliminate vulnerabilities in organizational information systems.\nInformation system security controls with be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the continued effectiveness of the controls.\nPolicy:  Configuration Management (CM) Guidance

A.18.1.1, A.18.2.2 The quality and integrity of RTI s standardized configuration settings allow information systems and information system components to be consistently deployed in an efficient and secure manner.\nWithout standardized configuration settings, the potential exists that information systems may be deployed that fail to meet the security requirements of RTI, or that compromise the security requirements of other information systems with which they interconnect.\nConfiguration baselines and inventories will be established and maintained of organizational information systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) throughout the respective system development lifecycles.\nEstablish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in organizational information systems.\nTrack, review, approve disapprove, and audit changes to RTI information systems.\nAnalyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation.\nDefine, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated with changes to the information system.\nIT Administrators will restrict, disable, and prevent the use of nonessential programs, functions, ports, protocols, and services.\nUser-installed software will be controlled and monitored.\nNetworks will be configured to restrict information flow between information systems or components of information systems using access control lists.\nAn asset inventory of information system components will be maintained.\nThe inventory will be updated when a new information system or information system component is implemented or an old one is retired.\nChange Management Change Management ensures that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt handling of all changes to control IT infrastructure, in order to minimize the number and impact of any related incidents upon service.\nAll IT Administrators changes are executed in a documented and predictable manner so that Users can plan accordingly.\nAll IT Administrator Divisions must follow the IT Change Management Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which provides the change management process for all production systems and associated resources.\nPage 9 of 18 Policy:  Contingency Planning (CP) Guidance Section NIST SP 800-53 CP-1 Contingency Planning

and contractual responsibilities to maintain and protect the confidentiality of all our customers  information.\nIn this respect it is the company s obligation to ensure employees, contractors, consultants and temporary employees are aware of and adequately trained regarding corporate security, privacy policies and standards.\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that RTI s incident response capabilities, used to monitor for security incidents have a maintained quality and integrity.\nThe incident response capabilities determine the magnitude of the threat presented by these incidents, and how to respond to these incidents.\nWithout an incident response capability, the potential exists that in the event that a security incident occurs, it will go unnoticed, and the magnitude of harm associated with the incident will be significantly greater than if the incident were noted and corrected.\nOCISO investigates and responds to any actual, threatened, suspected, or alleged security incident, including violation of RTI and IT security policies or a breach of information security safeguards (including any attempts to bypass, break through or override any information security safeguards).\nIncident reporting and notification is provided by OCISO to members of the incident response team, including the Privacy Office, Enterprise Risk Management, and

Overview    Purpose  The Information Security and Technology Policy ( Policy ) is dedicated to the following purposes.\nFirst, the  Policy is to convey the highest directive of cybersecurity posture of the City of Chicago ( City ) which stems to  a subset of administrative, operational, and technical controls.\nSecond, the Policy is developed, reviewed,  updated, and implemented to mitigate imminent and potential cybersecurity risks to employees and affiliated  third parties on data, network and information system owned by the City.\nThird, the Policy guides how the City  complies with applicable industry standards and regulations including the Health Information Portability and  Accountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the  Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Illinois State Local Records Act (LRA), the Illinois State Breach  Disclosure Laws, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), Criminal Justice  Information System (CJIS), American Water Works Association (AWWA).\nPolicies, Standards, Guidelines and Procedures Defined  -  A Policy consists of high-level statements relating to the protection of information across the organization  and should be produced and ratified by senior management.\nA documented policy is frequently a  requirement to satisfy regulations or laws, such as those relating to privacy and finance.\nIt is an  organizational mandate.\n-  Standards consist of specific low level mandatory controls that help enforce and support the information  security policy.\nStandards help to ensure security consistency across the business and usually contain  security controls relating to the implementation of specific technology, hardware, or software.\n-  Guidelines consist of recommended, non-mandatory controls that help support standards or serve as a  reference when no applicable standard is in place.\nGuidelines should be viewed as best practices that are  not usually requirements but are strongly recommended.\nThey could consist of additional recommended  controls that support a standard or help fill in the gaps where no specific standard applies.\n-  Procedures consist of step-by-step instructions to assist workers in implementing the various policies,  standards, and guidelines.\nWhile the policies, standards and guidelines consist of the controls that should  be in place, a procedure gets down to specifics, explaining how to implement these controls in a step-by- step fashion.\nPolicy Set Structure  To ensure that best practices are woven into the City s technology infrastructure, the policy set is built off of  industry standard framework: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP)  800-53 Revision 5.\nFurthermore, to satisfy multiple external legal and compliance requirements, such as Payment Card Industry  Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and  the State of Illinois Local Records Act, specific requirements have been included.\nEach Policy Standard has been noted with the specific framework requirements to enable rapid cross  reference of City Policy against compliance requirements.\nEach document consists of four level of hierarchical statements: Policy Number (Chapter, Numeric)   Article  (Numeric)   Clause (Numeric)   Item (Alphabetic).\nCity of Chicago      Applicability  The policies apply to all City of Chicago information technology systems and networks, those entrusted to  third-parties, City employees and others including but not limited to contractors, vendors and consultants.\nNot all departments in the City have the same technological implementations.\nWhile the policies reflect current  technology and security advances, implemented technologies in some departments may not be of immediate  compliance with the policy.\nUse of such technologies must be reviewed by the Chief Information Security  Officer and approved by the Chief Information Officer through a policy exception process.\nThese policies do not foresee any exceptional situations like new legal or regulatory obligations, best  practices, or emergencies that require actions that might conflict with policy statements.\nShould that occur, it  is the responsibility of the individual who has identified such a situation to report to the Chief Information  Security Office.\nCity of Chicago    Classification: Public    Page 1 of 5      Policy 1  Policy Owner  Policy Responsibilities

I.\nPurpose  A risk-based information data and computer asset classification scheme has been established in order to  ensure that data is handled and managed appropriately.\nData and computer assets are to be classified in a  manner that indicates the need, priorities, and expected degree of protection appropriate to the nature of the  data and the potential impact of misuse.\nPolicy Statements  6.1.\nResponsibility for computer and Information Assets  Computer and information ( data ) assets are to be accounted for and have an assigned owner.\nAcceptable use of City  assets should be understood by employees and contingent staff.\nOwnership of Computer Assets and Data  Unless specifically identified and approved by the Department of Law, information possessed or used by a particular  department and  information stored and processed over the City s technology and information systems are the property  of the City and are to have a designated Data Owner.\nCity employees and contingent staff have no expectation of privacy  associated with the information they store in or send through these systems, within the limits of the federal, state and  local laws of the United States and, where applicable, foreign laws.\nPhysical computing assets should have an assigned Asset Owner.\nProduction information possessed or used by a particular organization or business unit within the organization is to  have a designated Data Owner.\nOwnership and custodianship of assets is to be documented.\nData Governance  The accountability and responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of City owned and  managed data should be defined.\nThe below Table 1 provides definitions of the three defined data roles.\nThe Department of Innovation and  Technology and the Department of Law are responsible for developing the roles and responsibilities for proper  data handling procedures.\nTable 1 Data Roles and Responsibilities Definition  Data Owner  The individual(s), normally a manager or director, who has accountability and responsibility for  the integrity, accurate reporting and use of computerized data.\nThis individual(s) typically exist  within the department that generated the data and is ultimately accountable for its accuracy  and proper handling.\nData Custodian  The individual(s) and department(s) responsible for the storage, safeguarding and availability  of computerized data.\nThe Department of Innovation and Technology is a primary Custodian  within the City.\nData Consumer  The individual(s) and department(s) that use provided data to perform a job responsibility  including the possible generation of new data.\nA data consumer may also be a data custodian  if that person transfers data from its original location.\nExample: If an employee or contingent worker transfers data from a server or website to their  workstation, that individual is not only a consumer but also a custodian of that data and is  responsible for its proper handling.\nCity of Chicago    Data and Asset Classification                Page 2 of 4  6.1.3.\nAcceptable use of Computer Assets  The acceptable use of resources, information and assets should be documented and understood by staff (see  Acceptable Use and Personnel Security Policy).\nUse of these resources is intended for business purposes in accordance  with individual job function and responsibilities.\nPersonal use which is limited and in accordance with the City s Ethics  Ordinance, Personnel Rules and other Applicable Use policies is permitted.\nThe limited personal use of information  technology resources is not permissible if it creates a non-negligible expense to the City, consumes excessive time, or  violates departmental policy.\nThe privilege of limited personal use may be revoked or limited at any time by the City or  Department officials.\nThe Information Security Office is responsible for defining acceptable use of resources, information and assets  including appropriate labeling and handling procedures.\nIn the absence of specific guidance, Data Owners and  Department Management are primarily responsible for developing recommendations and minimum standards.\nAn up-to-date list of technologies as approved coordinated by Technical Operations and Enterprise Network  Architecture should be maintained and readily available.\nInventory of Computer Assets  An inventory of information assets, including systems, software, and service providers, is to be always kept current.\nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should compile and maintain a data repository catalog  on third party software-related assets (e.g., application software, development tools and third party purchased  software).\nThis catalog should be reviewed and updated annually.\nThe catalog should contain descriptive asset  information (e.g., vendor, logical locations associated applications or systems, physical location (if applicable),  owner responsible party, information custodial responsibilities, information classification and criticality level).\nBusiness leaders are to assist in maintaining this catalog and should communicate any changes or additions.\nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should compile and maintain a data repository catalog  of physical assets owned by the City.\nThis catalog should be reviewed and updated annually.\nThe catalog should  contain descriptive asset information.\nBusiness unit managers should assist Technical Operations and
