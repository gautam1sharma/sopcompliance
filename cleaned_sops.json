EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe main purpose of this document is to define the information security policy of the \nState of Tennessee along with the organization and framework structure required to \ncommunicate, implement, and support this policy. Information is an asset, which like \nany other asset owned by the State of Tennessee, has significant value to the \nstakeholders of the State. Information security is a critical component that is required \nto enable and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data, network and \nprocessing resources required for the State of Tennessee to perform its business and \noperational practices. This policy document has been created to establish and uphold \nthe minimum requirements that are necessary to protect Information Technology (IT) \nresources (assets) against unavailability, unauthorized or unintentional access, \nmodification, destruction, or disclosure as set forth by the Information Systems \nCouncil (ISC) of the State of Tennessee. \nThe scope of this document is intended to cover any information asset owned, leased, \nor controlled by, or operated on behalf of the State of Tennessee. The methodologies \nand practices of external entities that require access to the State of Tennessee s IT \nresources may be impacted and could be included in this scope. This document \nseeks to protect: \n All desktop computing systems, servers, data storage devices, communication \nsystems, firewalls, routers, switches, and mobile devices (computing platforms) \nowned by the State of Tennessee where lawfully permitted. \n All computing platforms, operating system software, middleware, or application \nsoftware under the control of third parties that connect in any way to the State \nof Tennessee s enterprise computing or telecommunications network. \n All data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases, or \nother information resource stored on the State of Tennessee s computing \nplatforms and or transferred by the State s enterprise network. \n All data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases, or \nother information resource stored on contractor computing platforms and or \ntransferred over contractor network infrastructure. \nThis document applies to all full- and part-time employees of the State of Tennessee, \nall third parties, outsourced employees or vendors who work on State premises or \nremotely connect their computing platforms to the State of Tennessee s computing \nplatforms and any cloud provider storing, processing, or transmitting State data. \nBy establishing the appropriate policy framework and utilizing a documented policy \ndevelopment process that includes all stakeholders, the State envisions maximum \nvoluntary compliance. The policy development and implementation process includes \nan impact analysis, input from Agency IT professionals and approval by the Chief \nInformation Security Officer (CISO) and Policy Review Committee within Strategic \nTechnology Solutions (STS), Department of Finance and Administration. \n2 \nAll IT resources and any information system owned by the State of Tennessee should \nbe protected from unauthorized disclosure, use, modification or destruction in a \nmanner commensurate with their value, sensitivity and criticality to the business and \noperation of the State government and those they serve. Access to information \ntechnology assets will be granted using the principle of least privilege which restricts \nthe access privileges of authorized individuals to the minimum necessary to perform \ntheir role. \nAll approved policies will support the guidelines established by the Information \nSystems Council of the State of Tennessee. \n3 \n2. INTRODUCTION \nThe Information Security Challenge \nIT solutions are driven by the demands of our daily business activities. The ability to \nprocure efficient communication, IT resources and technologies that support business \nprocesses at a low cost is a foundational component of successful IT programs. \nCloud technologies and offerings continue to grow, and this integration moves quickly \nto align itself with the just in time requirements of the business. Given the growth \ndemands of the business along with the associated time sensitive integration \nstrategies, we are presented with new risks at every turn. Organizations will \nfrequently take risks in order to meet those time sensitive business requirements, \nsometimes bypassing existing processes to meet time demands of the customers \nwhom they serve. As the State expands its use of cloud technologies, it is incumbent \nupon the State to ensure the State data that is hosted or processed in cloud \nenvironments or is transmitted across cloud infrastructure receives protection similar \nto what is provided by the STS managed data centers and infrastructure. This \npractice, also known as risk management, is a component of any successful \nbusiness. Modern enterprises will implement risk management and or information \nsecurity programs to mitigate these risks. \nThe State of Tennessee has recognized the need to evaluate risk and has established \ninformation security programs. One of the main goals of any successful information \nsecurity program is to protect the organization s revenues, resources, and reputation. \nThis is accomplished through several means. Some examples are implementing risk \nmanagement methodologies, security architectures, control frameworks and security \npolicy. \nSecurity policies are a foundational component of any successful security program. \nThe Enterprise Information Security Policy for the State of Tennessee is based on the \nInternational Standards Organization (ISO) 27000 series standard framework. This \npolicy is designed to comply with applicable statutes and regulations; however, if \nthere is a conflict, applicable statutes and regulations will take precedence. This \npolicy defines the minimum requirements for providing a secure operational \nenvironment. \nScope (2.1) \nThe scope of this document is intended to cover any information asset owned, \nleased or controlled by the State of Tennessee and the methodologies and \npractices of the State of Tennessee as well as external entities that require access \nto the State of Tennessee s IT resources. This document seeks to protect: \n All desktop computing systems, servers, data storage devices, \ncommunication systems, firewalls, routers, switches and mobile devices \n(computing platforms) controlled by or operated on behalf of the State of \nTennessee where lawfully permitted. \n All computing platforms, operating system software, middleware or \napplication software under the control of the State of Tennessee, or by third \nparties, operated on behalf of the State of Tennessee that connect in any \nway to the State s enterprise computing or telecommunications network or \nany State Cloud Tenant. \n All data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases or \nother information resource stored on the State of Tennessee s computing \nplatforms and or transferred by the State s enterprise network. \n All data, information, knowledge, documents, presentations, databases or \nother information resource stored on contractor computing platforms and or \ntransferred over contractor network infrastructure. \nAll full- and part-time employees of the State of Tennessee, all third parties, \noutsourced employees, or vendors who work on state premises or remotely \nconnect their computing platforms to the State of Tennessee s computing \nplatforms and any cloud provider storing, processing or transmitting State data \nshould adhere to the policies and requirements set forth in this document. \nAuthority (2.2) \nThe ISC authorized the Department of Finance and Administration, STS to \nestablish and enforce enterprise policies and standards related to information \nsecurity. These policies and standards include, but are not limited to, network and \nInternet access, any computing platform attached to the State s enterprise network \nand any wired or wireless technology attached to the State s enterprise network. \nSTS is responsible and authorized by the ISC to perform audits on any device that \nattaches to the State of Tennessee s enterprise network. \nReferences: \nTennessee Code Annotated, Section 4-3-5501, et seq., effective April 4, 2017 \nISC Information Resource Policies, Policy 1.00 (Data Security) \nISC Information Resource Policies, Policy 5.00 (Information Systems \nManagement and System Development Life Cycle) \nISC Information Resource Policies, Policy 9.00 (Disaster Recovery) \nISC Information Resource Policies, Policy 13.00 (Network Infrastructure \nSupport and Maintenance) \nExceptions (2.3) \nAll exceptions to any security policy will be reviewed, evaluated and processed by \na member of the CISO s staff. Some exceptions may also require signature of \nagency head to acknowledge and or accept associated risks. \nReview (2.4) \nReview of this document takes place within the STS Policy Review Committee \nsessions and will occur on an annual (within every three hundred and sixty-five \n(365) days) basis at a minimum. Document review can also be requested by \nsending a request to the CISO. \nThe official policy document and supporting documentation will be published on \nthe STS intranet site located at: \nhttps: www.teamtn.gov sts policies-and-procedures.html \nDocument Format (2.5) \nThis document generally follows the International Standards Organization 27000 \nseries standard framework for information technology security management. Each \nsection starts with a high-level security control category followed by the control \nobjective. Policy statements follow the objectives. \nThe MINIMUM COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS category contains the minimum \nrequirements for compliance criteria that are global and apply to all systems or \nplatforms across the entire enterprise. \nX. \nSection Name \nControl Category (x.x) \nObjective Statement \nPolicy Name (x.x.x) \nPolicy Statement \nSub-Policy Name (x.x.x.x) \nSub-Policy Statement \nMINIMUM COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS: \nPolicy Maintenance (2.6) \nAll policies will be maintained in accordance with the STS policy process \ndocumentation. \n3. INFORMATION SECURITY \nManagement Direction for Information Security (3.1) \nObjective: To provide management direction and support for information \nsecurity in accordance with agency business requirements and relevant \nstate and federal statute and regulations for the State of Tennessee s \ncomputing environments. \nInformation Security (3.1.1) \nSTS Information Security Management will initiate, control and \ncommunicate an enterprise information security architecture that \nincludes, but is not limited to, a policy framework, an organizational \nand communication framework and a security technology framework. \nAgency Policies for Information Security (3.1.2) \nAgencies should develop and communicate agency specific policy \ndocuments as required by agency or regulatory requirements \nprovided the minimum requirements set forth in this document are \nmet. \n4.

All documentation \ngenerated by the change control policies and procedures should be \nretained as evidence of compliance. \nChange Control Procedures (4.1.2.1) \nChange control procedures should include authorization, risk \nassessment, logging, auditability, and roll back procedures. \nCapacity Management (4.1.3) \nThe use of IT resources should be monitored and tuned so that \nprojections of future capacity requirements can be made. \nSeparation \nof \nDevelopment, \nTesting \nOperational \nEnvironments (4.1.4) \nDevelopment and testing environments should be segregated from \nproduction environments in order to reduce the risks of unauthorized \naccess or changes to the production environment. Data classified as \nconfidential must be protected from unauthorized disclosure, use, \nmodification or destruction and should not be used in development \nor test environments. \nProtection from Malware (4.2) \nObjective: Prevent the automated propagation of malicious code and \ncontamination of environments attached to the enterprise network. \nMalicious Software Control (4.2.1) \nAll computing platforms that are attached to the State s enterprise \ntechnology infrastructure or operated on behalf of the State should \nbe protected from intentional or unintentional exposure to malicious \nsoftware. Malicious software includes, but is not limited to, software \nviruses, worms, Trojan horses, logic bombs and rootkits. \nCompromised systems should be removed from the operational \nenvironment. All computing platforms that are attached to the State s \nenterprise technology infrastructure will participate in the State s \nenterprise antivirus program if antivirus signatures are available for \nthe computing platforms. STS Security Management reserves the \nright to seize any compromised system for forensic analysis. \nBackup (4.3) \nObjective: To prevent loss of data and to ensure data availability. \nData Backup (4.3.1) \nBackup copies of data, software and system images should be taken \nand tested regularly in accordance with established procedures. A \ncopy of the backup data should be stored off-site according to \napplicable regulatory requirements and State policy. Results of \nrestore \ntests \nshould \nbe \nfurnished \nto \ndata \nowners \nwith \nrecommendations for any remedial steps found. Data owners should \napprove any remedial plans and timelines for implementing those \nremediation steps within a reasonable period not to exceed three \nmonths. Following remediation, the restore testing should be \nrepeated and results documented to ensure that those steps \nmitigated all identified issues. \nLogging and Monitoring (4.4) \nObjective: To record events and generate evidence. \nEvent Logging (4.4.1) \nAll systems should be configured to support security event logging, \nrecording user activities, exceptions, faults and information security \nevents. \nSystem administrators should monitor and report \ninappropriate access to the STS Customer Care Center. Critical \nsystems should be configured to support automated logging to a \nfacility that protects the integrity of the logs. Logging levels and \nmonitored elements will be configured in accordance with federal and \nstate statute and regulatory requirements. \nAvailability and Performance Monitoring (4.4.2) \nCritical systems should be configured to support State approved \nautomated monitoring of system availability and performance. \nProtection of Log Information (4.4.3) \nLogging facilities and log information should be protected against \ntampering and unauthorized access. \nAdministrator and Logs (4.4.4) \nSystem administrator activities should be logged and the logs \nprotected and regularly reviewed. \nClock Synchronization (4.4.5) \nApproved State of Tennessee managed enterprise network time \nservers should be the only State devices permitted to synchronize \nwith external time services. All State provided or managed systems \nwill synchronize time with approved State of Tennessee managed \nenterprise network time servers. All non-State provided or managed \nsystems storing, processing or transmitting State data should be \nsynchronized to State approved time synchronization services. \nControl of Operational Software (4.5) \nObjective: To ensure the integrity of operational systems. \nInstallation of Software on Operational Systems (4.5.1) \nOnly software that has been licensed and approved as a State \nstandard software product or that has been approved as an \nexception through the State s architecture standards approval \nprocess should be installed on devices covered by the software s \nlicense agreement. \nPatch Management (4.5.1.1) \nAll applications and processing devices that are attached to \nthe State s enterprise technology infrastructure will have \ncritical security related application, operating system, and or \nsecurity related patches made available by the software or \nhardware vendor applied within 90 calendar days or sooner if \nan acceptable date can be agreed upon by all affected parties. \nEmergency patches and updates will be applied as soon as \npossible following successful validation and testing. \nPatch schedule: \n 14 days for critical patches addressing known exploits \n 30 days for high patches addressing known exploits \n 90 days for critical patches \n 90 days for high patches \nSoftware Maintenance (4.5.1.2) \nServers and workstation computing devices should have \ndefined maintenance windows within every 90 days. \nAppliances should have established review and maintenance \ncycles for software updates. \nSoftware Development Code (4.5.1.3) \nSoftware development code cannot be installed on production \nsystems (i.e. non-compiled software programming code). \nReview of Application and Operating System Changes \n(4.5.1.4) \nApplications and operating systems should be reviewed and \ntested to ensure that there is no adverse impact on operations \nor security when a change has been performed on the \noperating system. (e.g. patch). \nTechnical and Vulnerability Management (4.6) \nObjective: To prevent the exploitation of technical vulnerabilities. \nManagement of Technical Vulnerabilities (4.6.1) \nInformation about technical vulnerabilities on information systems \nand supporting infrastructure should be obtained in a timely fashion, \nevaluated for exposure and risk to the State and appropriate \nmeasures implemented to address the associated risk. \nRestrictions on Software Installation (4.6.2) \nUsers should not install software that has not been approved by STS \nand their agency. \nInformation Systems Audit Considerations (4.7) \nObjective: To minimize the impact of audit activities on operational systems. \nInformation Systems Audit Controls (4.7.1) \n12 \nAudit requirements and activities involving verification of operational \nsystems should be carefully planned and agreed upon in advance to \nminimize disruptions to business processes. \n5. ACCESS CONTROL \nBusiness Requirements of Access Control (5.1) \nObjective: To limit access to information and information processing \nfacilities. \nAccess Control (5.1.1) \nAll access rules and requirements to access the State of \nTennessee s IT resources should be developed, documented, and \nmaintained by their respective resource owners. Access to the State \nof Tennessee s IT resources will be granted consistent with the \nconcept of least privilege. All information processing systems owned \nby or operated on behalf of the State of Tennessee should have an \nappropriate role-based access control system that ensures only \nlegitimate users and or systems have access to IT resources that \nthey are explicitly authorized to use. \nAccess to Networks and Network Services (5.1.2) \nAll access and connectivity to the State of Tennessee s enterprise \nnetwork or networks operated on behalf of the State should be \ngranted consistent with the concept of least privilege. Users will only \nbe provided with access to the network and network resources that \nthey have been specifically authorized to use. \nRemote Access (5.1.2.1) \nAll users who are accessing the State s internal network \nshould access those resources through a State approved \nmultifactor Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. All users \nwho access State data on networks operated on behalf of the \nState should use secure connection methods.

In an interconnected world, information \nand associated process, systems, networks and personnel involved in the operation \nare valuable to an organization s business and consequently deserve or require \nprotection against various hazards. The fast pace of adoption of technological \ninnovations have increased exposure to cyber incidents underlining the need to have \na robust information and cyber security framework. Cyber incidents and attacks have \nincreased in frequency in recent past. Hence, it is essential that the financial system \nenhances cyber resiliency through the individual action of financial institutions and \nthrough increased coordination across participants, including the sharing of \ninformation and developing a set of commonly understood rigorous practices through \nadoption of information and cyber security plan and crisis management plan. The \ninformation technology sector which thrives on cyber space, plays a significant role in \ninfluencing and improving the lives of people through direct and indirect contribution \nto the delivery of various services. Such a focus necessitates creation of a suitable \ncyber security eco-system in the country, in tune with globally networked environment. \nCyberspace is a complex environment consisting of interactions between people, \nsoftware, services, and supported by worldwide distribution of information and \ncommunication technology (ICT) devices and networks. \nThe mission of India s National Cyber Security Policy -2013 is to protect information \nand information infrastructure in cyberspace, build capabilities to prevent and respond \nto cyber threats, reduce vulnerabilities, and minimize damage from cyber incidents \nthrough a combination of institutional structures, people, processes, technology, and \ncooperation. The NCSP mandates all government organizations to develop \ninformation security policies duly integrated with their business plans and implement \nsuch policies as per international best practices.

Specific information needed \nto support technical vulnerability management includes the software \nvendor, version numbers, current state of deployment (e.g., what \nsoftware is installed on what systems) and the person(s) within the \nf. If products are acquired from a third party, a formal testing and \nacquisition process should be followed. Contracts with the supplier \nshould address the identified security requirements. Where the security \nfunctionality in a proposed product does not satisfy the specified \nrequirement, the risk introduced and associated controls shall be \nreconsidered prior to purchasing the product. Criteria for accepting \nproducts should be defined in terms of their functionality, to assure that \nthe identified security requirements are met. \ng. Information and cyber security considerations for application services \npassing over public networks should include the following: \ni. Authorization processes associated with approval of content, \nissue resolution, or to sign key transactional documents; \nii. The protection requirements of any confidential information; \niii. Selecting the most appropriate settlement form of payment by the \nFinance and Accounts Department to guard against any possible \nfraud; \niv. Ensuring that the storage of confidential documents is not publicly \naccessible e.g., on a storage platform on the organizational \nPage 19 of 25 \nintranet, and not retained and exposed on a storage medium \ndirectly accessible from the Internet; and \nv. Official organizational email IDs shall be assigned to all staff \nbarring outsourced and usage of other email services such as \nGmail etc. be avoided. \nh. Sensitive or critical official information, whether physical or electronic \nshould be properly secured (ideally in a safe or cabinet or other forms of \nsecurity furniture) when not required, especially when the office is \nvacated. \ni. Computers and terminals should be logged off or protected with a screen \nand keyboard locking mechanism controlled by a password, token, or \nsimilar user authentication mechanism when not in use. \nj. Ensuring uninterrupted power supply as frequent and sudden power \noutages or fluctuations can lead to motherboard crashes and may lead \nto data corruption. Power backup system such as UPS shall be installed. \nk. When using mobile devices, special care should be taken to ensure that \nbusiness information is not compromised. \nl. Password management systems should be interactive and should \nensure secure passwords. \nm.

Operating procedures shall be documented and made available to all \nusers who need them. Documented procedures shall be prepared for \noperational activities associated with information processing and \ncommunication facilities, such as computer start-up and close-down \nprocedures, backup, media handling, and mail handling management. \nPage 20 of 25 \no. All storage media shall be verified to ensure that any sensitive data and \nlicensed software has been removed or securely overwritten prior to \ndisposal or re-use. \np. The date and time of entry and departure of visitors shall be recorded, \nand supervised. \nq. An information and cyber security awareness program shall be held \nregularly to make employees aware of their responsibilities and the \nmeans by which those responsibilities are discharged. \n18. Information and cyber security aspects of Business Continuity Management \n18.1 Business Continuity Management (BCM) \nBCM is a management process that identifies risk, threats and vulnerabilities that could \nimpact an entity s continued operations and provides a framework for building \norganizational resilience and the capability for an effective response. Business \ncontinuity plan sets out in detail as to how a particular strategy will be implemented in \norder to meet the defined requirements. \nThe information and cyber security continuity shall be embedded in the organization s \nbusiness continuity management systems. \na. NPS Trust shall determine its requirements for information and cyber security \nand the continuity of information and cyber security management in adverse \nsituations i.e., during a crisis or disaster. \nb. NPS Trust shall establish, document, implement and maintain processes, \nprocedures, and controls to ensure the required level of continuity for \ninformation and cyber security during adverse situations. \nc. NPS Trust shall verify the established and implemented information and cyber \nsecurity continuity controls at regular intervals in order to ensure that they are \nvalid and effective during adverse situations. \nPage 21 of 25 \n18.2 Redundancies \nInformation-processing facilities shall be implemented with redundancy sufficient to \nmeet availability requirements. \n18.3 Business Continuity Plan (BCP) \n18.3.1 NPS Trust shall establish documented procedures in order to respond, \nrecover, resume, and restore to a pre-defined level of operation following disruption. \nThe plan shall ensure that employees and assets are protected and are able to restore \nfunction quickly in the event of a disaster. It shall be conceived in advance and involve \ninput from key stakeholders and employees. BCP shall define all risks that can affect \nthe organization s operations, making it an important part of the organization s risk \nmanagement strategy. Risks may include natural disasters fire, flood, or weather- \nrelated events and cyber-attacks. \nThe plan shall include: \na. Determining how those risks will affect operations; \nb. Implementing safeguards and procedures to mitigate the risks; \nc. Testing procedures to ensure they work; and \nd. Reviewing the process to make sure that it is up to date. \nBCPs are different from a disaster recovery plan, which focuses on the recovery of a \ncompany s IT system after a crisis. \n18.3.2. Developing a Business Continuity Plan \nSteps to develop BCP shall include: \na. Business Impact Analysis: Identify functions and related resources that are \ntime-sensitive. \nb. Recovery: Identify and implement steps to recover critical business functions. \nPage 22 of 25 \nc. Organization: Creation of team to focus on business continuity. This team shall \ndevise a plan to manage the disruption. \nd. Training: The team shall be trained and tested. Members of the team should also \ncomplete practicing exercises associated with BCP. \nNPS Trust shall keep a checklist to include key details such as emergency contact \ninformation, a list of resources the business continuity team may need, where the \nbackup data and other required information is housed or stored, and other important \npersonnel details. Along with testing the business continuity team, the NPS Trust shall \nalso test the BCP itself. It shall be tested several times to ensure it can be applied to \nmany different risk scenarios. This will help identify any weaknesses in the plan which \ncan then be identified and corrected. \n19. Asset management \n19.1 Responsibility for assets: \nNPS Trust shall identify the organizational assets and define appropriate protection \nresponsibilities. \na. Assets associated with information and information processing facilities shall \nbe identified and an inventory of these assets shall be drawn up and \nmaintained. \nb. Rules for the acceptable use of information and of assets associated with \ninformation and information processing facilities shall be identified, documented \n,and implemented. \nc. All employees and external party users shall return all organizational assets in \ntheir possession upon termination of their employment, contract or agreement. \nPage 23 of 25 \n19.2 \nInformation classification: \na. Information shall be classified in terms of legal requirements, value, criticality \nand sensitivity to unauthorized disclosure or modification. \nb. An appropriate set of procedures for information labelling shall be developed \nand implemented in accordance with the information classification scheme \nadopted by the organization. \nc. Procedures for handling assets shall be developed and implemented in \naccordance with the information classification scheme adopted by the \n20. Access control \nAn access control policy shall be established, documented, and reviewed based on \nbusiness, information, and cyber security requirements. \na. Users shall only be provided with access to the network and network services \nthat they have been specifically authorized to use. \nb. A formal user registration and de-registration process shall be implemented to \nenable assignment of access rights. \nc. A formal user access provisioning process shall be implemented to assign or \nrevoke access rights for all user types to all systems and services. \nd. The allocation and use of privileged access rights shall be restricted and \ncontrolled. The allocation of secret authentication information shall be \ncontrolled through a formal management process. \nPage 24 of 25 \ne. The access rights of all employees and external party users to information and \ninformation processing facilities shall be removed upon termination of their \nemployment, contract, or agreement, or adjusted upon change. \nf. Users shall be made accountable for safeguarding their authentication \ninformation. \ng. Access to information and application system functions shall be restricted in \naccordance with the access control policy. \nh. Password management systems shall be interactive and shall ensure secure \npasswords. \n21. Compliance \nNPS Trust shall avoid breaches of legal, statutory, regulatory, or contractual \nobligations related to information and cyber security and of any security requirements. \n22. Conclusion \nInformation and cyber security policy is a foundation of a good security program for \nany organization. Information and cyber security shall be achieved by implementing a \nsuitable set of controls, including policies, processes, procedures, organizational \nstructures and software hardware functions. These controls need to be established, \nimplemented, monitored, reviewed, and improved on a continuous basis to ensure that \nthe specific security and business objectives of the organization are met. NPS Trust \nshall take a holistic and coordinated view of the organization s information and cyber \nsecurity risks in order to implement a comprehensive suite of information and cyber \nsecurity controls under the overall framework of a coherent management system. \nThe information and cyber security policy can be effective only if employees adhere to \nit. Identifying appropriate controls requires careful planning and attention to detail. A \nPage 25 of 25 \nsuccessful information and cyber security policy requires support from all employees \nin the organization, participation from stakeholders, suppliers, and specialists advisors. \nSuccessful implementation of the policy would help the organization to report cyber \nincidents proactively and minimize and contain the damage. The continuous \nsurveillance would arm the existing capabilities of information and cyber security \nframework leading to development of an effective and robust security thereby ensuring \nthat the organization s assets are reasonably safe and protected against any cyber \nthreats. \nThis policy shall be operationalized by way of detailed standard operating procedures \n(SOPs) and internal circulars and plans of action at various levels of the organization \nas may be appropriate, to address the challenging requirement of information and \ncyber security."

Introduction \nGodrej Industries Limited and Associate Companies (GILAC) intends to follow process-based approach to \ndesign, implement, improve and maintain information security across all group companies. GILAC looks \nat information security as a strategic issue and has therefore set up a Group Chief Information Security \nOfficer (CISO) role to be primarily responsible for implementing and monitoring the GILAC s information \nsecurity policies processes. This entails creation of a framework which will govern the entire information \nsecurity aspect. \nInformation Security is the protection of Information and Information Assets, from a wide range of threats \nin order to safeguard business and profits. It is the practice of defending information from unauthorized \naccess, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction. \nInformation Security Management System (ISMS) is an overall management system, based on a business \nrisk approach, to establish implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve information \nsecurity. ISMS is a systematic approach to manage sensitive company information so that it remains secure. \nIt encompasses People, Process and Technology. \nIt provides the following benefits to GILAC: \nProtects the GILAC s information assets \nManages and minimizes risk exposure \nEnhances customer satisfaction that improves customer retention \nBuilds a culture of security \nKeeps confidential information secure \nAllows secure exchange of information \nEnsures meeting legal obligations \nProvides consistency in the delivery of service or product \n1.1. \nFive design principles for Security at GILAC \nInformation Security is everyone s business \nEnsure all regulatory requirements are fulfilled in compliance and in spirit \nEnsure Segregation of duties (e.g. design implementation v s validate) \nZero Trust in all aspects of Information Access \nInculcate a strong Security mind-set \n1.2. \nGeneral Requirements of ISMS \nPeople, process, and technology are critical to GILAC for the conduct of its operations.

Five default categories \nare suggested. They are: \n nternal Use \nConfidential \nHighly confidential \nThese classifications have been designed to protect information from unauthorized disclosure, \nuse, modification or deletion, based on need to know policy, i.e. access to corporate \ninformation shall be restricted with the e ect that only those who have an evident business \nreason to access the information shall be granted access. \n nformation which is not specifically classified should be scrutinized to ascertain the \nclassification, and if this cannot be done then the information should by default be deemed to \nbe classified as nternal Use, and therefore should be treated accordingly. \n n this appendix: \nAn access control list for a piece of information is a list of persons or parties authorized to \nhave the right to access the information, \nA distribution list is a list of persons or parties to which a piece of information is physically \ndistributed. \n1.1 \n Public classification applies to information that has been explicitly approved by the \nmanagement of the relevant business entity for disclosure to the public outside of the \nPage 14 of 16 \nOnly designated persons may classify information as Public. \nOnly designated persons may disclose Public information. Such disclosure shall follow \npredefined procedures, rules and guidelines. \n1.2 \nInternal Use \n nternal Use classification applies to information that, if disclosed inadvertently or without \nauthorization, could have negative consequences for the business unit, the sub-group or \nHUTCHMED Group and may induce costs in redressing those consequences. \n nternal Use information shall not be disclosed to anybody outside of the HUTCHMED Group \nwithout prior approval by the nformation Owner. f the nternal Use information has any access \ncontrol list, it shall not be disclosed to any other persons outside such access restriction without \nprior approval by the nformation Owner. nternal Use information without an access control \nlist may be disclosed within the HUTCHMED Group. \n nformation Owner may also impose additional disclosure or handling restrictions to nternal \nUse information. Additional restrictions must not weaken the basic disclosure rules stated in \nthis document. \n1.3 \n Departmental information can be freely shared with members of the owning department. \nSharing such information with individuals outside of the owning department requires \nauthorization by the appropriate nformation Owner. \n1.4 \nCon dential \n Confidential classification applies to information that, if disclosed inadvertently or without \nauthorization, could have significant negative consequences for the business unit, the sub-\ngroup or HUTCHMED Group and may induce significant costs in redressing those consequences. \nConfidential information should always have a distribution list or access control list, and should \nnot be disclosed to any persons outside such distribution list or access control list without prior \napproval by the nformation Owner. n the absence of an access control list, the distribution list \nis deemed to be the access control list. n the absence of both the distribution and access \ncontrol lists, Confidential information shall not be disclosed to anybody without prior approval \nby the nformation Owner. \nPage 15 of 16 \n nformation Owner may also impose additional disclosure or handling restrictions to \nConfidential information. Additional restrictions must not weaken the basic disclosure rules \nstated in this document. \n n addition, Confidential information must be further protected against deliberate and \ninadvertent unauthorized disclosure in its handling, including display, storage, transmission \nand disposal. \n1.5 \nHighly con dential \n Highly confidential information can only be shared on a need to know basis with a limited \nnumber of individuals who have been identified by the appropriate nformation Owner. \nDue to the diversity of HUTCHMED Group business and local legislative, HUTCHMED Group \nbusiness units should further take into the account of their business needs, the compliance to \nvarious legislation and industry requirements to set up the desirable categories. However, the \nultimate categories shall be able to be mapped into the 5 default categories and shall not \nviolate or contradict to the principles set out in this policy. \nInformation Labeling \nManagement of business entities is responsible for assessing, designing and implementing \napplicable specific procedures for information labeling for their respective business entities. \nHowever, such activity should be justified and supported by the following criteria: \n1. t is required by local legislation, or \n2. Without other alternatives, individual labeling is the only way that stakeholders could \naware of the sensitive of the information, and: \n t is technically feasible, and \n t is economically feasible. That is, the total benefit of such exercise outweighs the \ncost including on-going maintenance cost. \n f a business entity does decide to go ahead with labeling, the following rules should apply: \nConfidential information should be the first to be labeled. \nThe nformation Owner is responsible to label the information according to its \nclassification. \nPage 16 of 16 \nOnly the nformation Owner or a person designated by the nformation Owner should be \nauthorized to change the classification label on information. \nThe classification label should be readily apparent. \nThe access control list and any additional restrictions should be clearly stated on the \nclassification label or otherwise be readily apparent. For example, a classification label \nmay be nternal Use -For Company X Use Only or Confidential - For Department XX Use \nOnly or nternal Use - For HUTCHMED Group nternal Use Only . \nThe access control list or additional restrictions cannot replace the classification, i.e. \nirrespective of any additional restrictions; the classification of the information (e.g. \nConfidential) should be on the label."

The university relies heavily on digital technology as well as on printed \ndocuments and records. The university will implement information security controls and \npractices to safeguard its information, while also enabling staff, students, visitors, and \npartners to access and use the information they need. \nThis Policy is based on the following standards, regulations, and legislation: \n UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and ICO Guidance \n Data Protection Act 2018 \n Investigatory Powers (Interception by Businesses etc, for Monitoring Record \nKeeping Purposes) Regulations 2018 \n ISO IEC 27001 27002 \n NCSC Cyber Essentials Scheme and NCSC Cyber Security Toolkit for Boards \n2.0 Scope \nAny individual who handles information on behalf of the university as part of their work or \nrole (students, staff, researchers, honorary staff, and third parties carrying out a university \nfunction) must adhere to this Policy. \nThis policy relates to securing university information and working to ensure an appropriate \nbalance of the confidentiality, integrity, availability and safety of the information and \nsystems. Information that is valuable to the university (whether owned, generated by, or \nentrusted to the University) should be protected from theft, misuse, or compromise that \ncould impact: \n an individual s reasonable expectations of privacy, security, and safety. \n the university s ability to carry out its work. \n the university s reputation and ability to meet legal, ethical, and regulatory \nrequirements. \nInformation can be written, electronic, or verbal and can include (but is not limited to): \nemail correspondence; published documents; teaching material; plans and strategy \ndocuments; exam papers and assessments; data, analysis, and findings (both research \nand institutional data); information held on student and staff systems; disciplinary or \ngrievance proceedings. Whatever the form, valuable and sensitive information must be \nappropriately protected throughout its lifecycle (collecting, storing, using, sharing, \ntransferring, retaining and disposal). \nPage 3 of 11 \nThis policy supports and should be read in conjunction with (sits alongside) the Data \nProtection Policy, Records Retention Schedule, IT Acceptable Use Policy and the \nInformation Protection Guide (see Related Documentation Section for links). \n3.0 Policy Statements: Information Security Framework \nAn information security framework is effective when using layers of security controls: \nphysical; policy; personnel; technical; and incident management. It is not sufficient to \nsolely rely on IT Services or a previous legacy set up. All users of university information \nmust apply a combination of controls and safeguards, to maintain and protect the \nconfidentiality, integrity, availability, and safety of university information. \nFour simple principles apply: \n1. Know what you have \n2. Assess the risks \n3. Protect \n4. Govern and Review \n3.1 \nKnow what you have \nRequires clear ownership of and responsibility for assets. \nA. \nAccountable Owners: Business Data Owners \nAll information must have a clearly defined owner or custodian called a Business or Data \nOwner. The Business Owner is usually the senior person responsible and accountable for \nthe function that creates and uses that information from creation to consumption and end \nof use (e.g., Dean, Head of Department, Principal Investigator, Research Academic \nSupervisor, Manager, etc.). The Data Owner may be at any level in the organisation a \nsmall team or even a sole researcher, with responsibility for protecting the information they \nhave been entrusted with. \nFor consistency of scope, the term Data Owner will be used in this policy. \nThe Data Owner is responsible for putting rules and processes in place around access, \nuse, quality and accuracy, storage and security, and ensuring compliance with those \ndocumented rules. Data ownership also applies to each individual user who stores and \nprocesses university information and is responsible for protecting it. \nB. \nAsset Registers \nData Owners must know what data, infrastructure, IT equipment, information and IT \nsystems, software, cloud services, and storage they use. This is key to defining \nDepartmental Business Continuity Plans. \nData Owners are responsible for ensuring their data is securely managed regardless of \nlocation i.e., whether in local departmental systems, in IT Services centrally managed \nfacilities and services or in third party hosted solutions. \nData Owners (or their delegates), whether at a business area, school, department, or \nfaculty level must maintain and update an Asset Register (See Knowledge Article \nPage 4 of 11 \nInformation Security). Data Owners should notify IT Services, of new devices or systems \nbefore they are procured and connected. This is to ensure end user devices are \nappropriately protected and managed (See IT Services Computer Security), and to \nensure the Data System Owner carries out appropriate assessment and security checks. \nSee Section 3.2 Assess the risks. \nIT Services maintain an asset register of centrally managed applications, systems and \nservices as recorded in the IT Service catalogue. \nC. \nSystem Owner Administrator \nSystem Owners Administrators are nominated roles: in charge of and responsible for \nmanaging the systems which provide the service. This role is sometimes also referred to \nas Data Steward. \ni. \nCentrally managed IT facilities \nThe IT Services Department (IT Services) is the System Owner for the university s \ncentrally managed IT facilities, storage, systems, services, and infrastructure ( IT \nfacilities and services ) that underpin university information assets. IT Services \nstaff, as system owners administrators for named systems, will work in \ncollaboration with the Data Owner to manage and protect the information. See \nSection 3.3 Protect. \nii. \nSystem owner administrator for non-centrally managed IT facilities \nIf university departments have established local information systems which are not \ncentrally managed or supported, the Data Owner, and their nominated system \nowners administrators must manage these facilities to the same minimum-security \nbaseline standards as IT Services. See Section 3.3 Protect. \nD. \nUsers and Acceptable Use \nThe university IT Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) (See Related Documentation) outlines \nexpected behaviours that all Users of IT facilities and services (students, staff, \nresearchers, honorary members, and third parties carrying out a university function) must \ncomply with. The AUP includes rules for the acceptable and prohibited use of university IT \nfacilities and services, including responsibility for protecting University information. It links \nto relevant misconduct and or disciplinary policies in the event of misuse. \nE. \nTraining and Awareness \nThe university is committed to supporting and promoting staff awareness of their \ninformation security responsibilities through a framework of policies, guidance, webpages, \nteam briefings, staff obligatory e-learning and cyber security awareness training. \nTraining should be appropriate to role. For example, system owners administrators with \nprivileged access, or business areas who regularly handle high risk information, should \nundertake appropriate training, and adhere to documented operating procedures. Data \nowners, as part of their Faculty and Department structure and responsibilities for \nprotecting university information, are responsible for organising relevant training within \ntheir business area to enable staff to protect university information and infrastructure. \nPage 5 of 11 \n3.2 \nAssess the risks \nWhen planning to procure or develop new information systems, IT facilities and services \ndata and system owners should give as much advance notice as possible to relevant \ncentral professional services departments (including, but not limited to: IT Services, Legal, \nFinance and Procurement). This is to: \n ensure effective use of university resources (financial, infrastructure and workforce). \n prioritise workload against existing demands. \n ensure the system meets the minimum-security baseline (see section 3.3) and \nenterprise architecture principles \n assess the impact, and integration with current university systems. \n assess and build in data protection privacy and transparency requirements. \nThis Information Security Policy supports Data Owners and System Owners to carry out \nan appropriate assessment by signposting relevant processes and templates. See \nKnowledge Article Information Security for an overview of key information risk assessment \nprocesses. \nWhere baseline requirements cannot be met, an exception to the minimum-security \nbaseline should be raised. Although this exception will be assessed and recorded by IT \nServices, it is the data owner system owner responsibility to own and mitigate the risks. \nData Classification: Assessing and classifying information using the Data classification \nScheme (Figure 1 below) focuses effort and resources into identifying and protecting the \nmost sensitive and valuable information. Figure 1 below summarises the three data \nclassifications which underpin this Information Security Policy. \nPublic \nInternal \nConfidential \nInformation intended \nfor sharing in the \npublic domain \nInformation used for day-\nto-day University functions \nnot for general public \nDefault classification \nAny quantity of Personal data (about \nliving people) or information with \ncontractual, business or research \nvalue \nNo adverse impact \nSome adverse impact and \ndisruption to services. \nPossible breach of \nconfidence or statutory \nduty \nSerious privacy or reputational risk, \nfinancial impact, commercial \ndisadvantage or disruption to services \nBreach of statutory regulatory duty \nrisk of fine \nInformation \ncategorised as \nPUBLIC does not need \nany special handling \nrequirements. \nAccess should be \nappropriate to role and is \nprotected by min. one \nbarrier e.g., username and \npassword for technical \nsecurity. ID access control \nAccess should be: appropriate to role \nand authorised by the Data Business \nOwner; protected with more than one \nbarrier; encrypted when in transit; \nshared only with appropriate \nPage 6 of 11 \nPublic \nInternal \nConfidential \nor locked office cupboard \nfor physical security. \nUse centrally managed IT \nfacilities (approved cloud \nand University premises) \npersonnel; securely destroyed at end \nof use. \nUse centrally managed IT facilities \nand services (on university \npremises and approved Cloud) \nincl. full disk encryption on all \nmobile storage devices \nThe higher the risk of compromise, the more layers of protection (physical, technical, \npersonnel and procedural security) are necessary to secure it. The Information Protection \nGuide outlines how the university expects different aspects of data classification and \nprotection measures to be applied (from creation through to disposition) by all Users of \nuniversity information. \n3.3 \nProtect \nIT Services provide and are responsible for ensuring centrally managed IT facilities and \nservices meet external security standards, self-assessments, audits, and other regulatory \nframeworks. Data system owners are responsible for adhering to the same standards for \nany locally procured or legacy systems. \nSecurity standards are a pre-requisite for organisations to collaborate on research, obtain \nfunding or to obtain and use partner organisation s data. The standards and certifications \ninclude (but are not limited to): NCSC Cyber Essentials, NHS Data Security Protection \nToolkit, Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), Web Accessibility \nStandard WCAG2.2 AA EN 301 549 and Cyber Security audit. Protection measures and \nstandards are reflected within the University across 4 main aspects: \nA. \nMinimum-security baseline \nThe minimum-security baseline is a requirement across all university IT facilities and \nservices, to comply with information and cyber security requirements as well as external \nsecurity certifications. A programme of work is underway within IT Services to mitigate \nrisks within centrally managed legacy systems to meet the minimum-security baseline or \nupdate to compliant solutions. \nProposals to buy new or to upgrade existing IT facilities and services must be submitted to \nIT services for assessment and approval. The Supplier Security Questionnaire (SSQ) \nprovides security due diligence on a supplier and their solution service to operate in a \nsecure manner before entrusting the supplier with university data. This SSQ process helps \ndepartments to minimise and manage risk to their data and to the university infrastructure \nand reputation. \nSee Knowledge Article Information Security for steps to initiate a Supplier Security \nQuestionnaire (items 1-3). The table below lists the minimum-security baseline and secure \ndesign requirements. \nPage 7 of 11 \nMinimum-security baseline \nAuthentication \nand account \nmanagement \nAll systems must be protected with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) \nAll systems must be protected with the university central IT account \nmanagement (IT Services Single Sign On (SSO)) \nSupplier should have clearly defined account management \nprocedures for own staff and their third parties: authentication and \nauthorisation; and technical security measures to prevent a malicious \nor compromised user in the Supplier environment from affecting the \ndata or service \nActivity logging \nAudit trail of user and system actions and events to provide \ntraceability of the use of a service \nVulnerability \nmanagement \nSystems and infrastructure are underpinned by operating system and \nsoftware applications which need to be checked (scanned) and fixed \n(patched) to reduce vulnerability to cyber-attack. \nSupplier should have an active vulnerability and patch management \nprocedure and be able to apply patches for critical and high severity \nvulnerabilities in line with Cyber Essentials requirements. \nAntimalware \nprotection \nAll IT systems, cloud services, and computing devices (infrastructure \nand endpoint) must have antimalware protection. \nEncryption \nUniversity data should be protected in transit (transmitted across the \ninternet - at least TLS1.2) and at rest (AES256). \nDesign \nTechnologies \nTechnologies, protocols and web browsers etc should be actively \nmaintained and be supported (i.e. receiving updates and patches). \nDesign \nIntegrations \nData flow and integrations with existing systems should be clearly \ndefined and secured. Will be subject to assessment by IT Services \nEnterprise Architects. \nBack Up, \nResilience and \nAvailability \nRegularly taking backups of data, testing restores and having detailed \nassurances about the resilience and availability of a system is \nessential. Supplier to provide information about their back-up solution, \ndisaster recovery process and service support package. \nDepartment Business Continuity Plans should incorporate back up \nresilience and availability of locally managed systems. \nNetwork \nconnectivity \nOnly necessary network services to be accessed from the internet to \nreduce exposure to attack. IT Services to assess and approve. \nConfiguration of \nequipment \nComputers and network devices should be configured to reduce \nvulnerabilities and provide only the services required to fulfil their role. \nSee also Infrastructure Management Code of Practice and Shared \nResponsibility Matrix \nPage 8 of 11 \nB. \nInformation Handover and End of Use \nAll university information should be returned to the university when users leave or move to \nanother role (i.e., staff, researchers, students, honorary members, and third parties \ncarrying out a university function). This includes informing appropriate staff of information \nhandover arrangements to ensure the university retains ownership and custody of the \ninformation. \nAll members of the university should comply with the University Retention Schedule for \nend of use secure disposal or preservation of information. Internal and Confidential \ninformation should be destroyed beyond the ability to recover it (paying due regard to \nenvironmental and legislative requirements around waste and hazardous waste \nprocessing). Secure disposal arrangements for data bearing IT equipment and sensitive \npaper waste are subject to contracts and documented procedures. This is to manage the \nchain of custody; securely erase or destroy the data; and provide destruction certification \nfrom the third party services. \no IT Services has a contract with a third-party IT Asset Disposal Partner for \nsecure disposal of all data bearing IT equipment. Information remains on IT \nequipment even when a user has deleted the file, therefore secure erasure, \nand disposal of IT equipment via the IT Services contracted service is \nmandatory. Donating university computing equipment or removing data \nstorage from computing devices are not secure destruction methods and \nconstitute a breach of University Policy. It is each Department s and School s \nresponsibility to ensure all data bearing IT equipment and end user devices \nare collected and securely erased by the contracted IT Asset Disposal \nPartner. https: www.liverpool.ac.uk it my-computer disposal \no IT Services (Information Records Management team) provide \nappropriate facilities enabling staff to carry out secure disposal of sensitive \npaper waste via secure locked consoles or confidential waste bags (which \nare collected and shredded by a third-party contractor). Contact Information \n Records Management for advice on disposal of non-paper confidential \nwaste e.g., USBs and CDs. https: www.liverpool.ac.uk it records-\nmanagement storage-and-disposal confidential-waste \nC. \nIncident Reporting: \nAll Users of university information, IT facilities and services are responsible for reporting \ndata loss and security incidents. \n Report a loss or compromise of personal data immediately to the university Data \nProtection Officer. See https: www.liverpool.ac.uk intranet legal data-protection-foi-\nstaff data-breach Ensure your Line Manager is also aware. \n Contact IT Services Service Desk immediately https: www.liverpool.ac.uk it getting-\nhelp .via Phone: 44 (0)151 794 4567. \nD. \nCyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT): \nPage 9 of 11 \nThe CSIRT is a cross functional team of IT Services staff, with support from Legal \nGovernance staff, who respond to IT security incidents and policy breaches, associated IT \nInvestigation requests, activity, and vulnerability reporting. \nA core function of the CSIRT is to effectively investigate the cause(s) of an IT security \nincident and implement measures to recover and to mitigate risk to the university. \nThe CSIRT may pass information relating to an IT security incident or breach to external \norganisations for information or further action. These may include (but are not limited to) \nthe Information Commissioner s Office (ICO), the Police or other Statutory bodies. \n3.4 \nGovern and review \nA security governance framework is not just policy compliance. It is about embedding \nresponsibility for information across all aspects of university work. Enabling the culture that \nrecognises the value and importance of data, how it underpins our business goals, and \nhow it supports all aspects of university research, teaching and learning, professional \nservices, and wider collaboration. \nThis Information Security Policy is part of the foundations supporting the university to \ncontrol, direct and communicate cyber security risk management activities, through a \nCyber Security Awareness, Behaviour and Culture (ABC) programme. \nInformation Governance Committee \nThe remit of the Information Governance Committee (which reports to Formal Senior \nLeadership Team and risk oversight to Audit Committee) helps to set direction and be \naccountable for information governance related policies and management arrangements to \nensure they are compatible with the strategic direction of the organisation: handling and \nprotecting information throughout its lifecycle. This includes monitoring compliance with \nInformation Governance related policies and oversight of information risk management. \nBusiness Continuity \nThe University Business Continuity Policy is overseen by the Property Campus Services \nDepartment, with contributions from all relevant areas of the university. All Schools and \nDepartments should maintain, review, and test their local IT Business Continuity Plans \n(BCPs) to integrate with the University approach. \nPayment Card Data Security \nThe university has an established PCI steering group which oversees the teams managing \nall payment card processing (and cardholder information) across the university. The \nPayment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Finance Policy sets out the \nrules for protecting the security of all card payments received and processed by the \nUniversity. \nOperating Procedures and documentation \nSenior Management Teams should oversee and validate that procedures are in place e.g. \nStandard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Data and System Owners should ensure they \nhave implemented relevant controls: responsibilities, risk assessment, protection, and \ngovernance measures as outlined in this Information Security Policy.\nPage 10 of 11 \n3.0 Policy Compliance \nFailure to comply with this Policy and the supporting Information Protection Guide in \nprotecting university information (or that entrusted to us by a third party) puts the university \nat risk of reputational damage, financial penalty, breach of legal, contractual or regulatory \nrequirement. It may also lead to disciplinary action in accordance with the relevant \nDisciplinary Policy (staff or student) or misconduct investigation in accordance with \nrelevant Misconduct Policy. \n4.0 Related Documentation \nThis section lists directly relevant guidance and policies that have been referenced within \nthis Information Security Policy.

Policy Linkage \nThis document is primarily based on ISO 27001:2013 guidelines and has linkages references from \nindustry standard security framework and relevant regulatory publications. \n5 \n7. Policy Statement \nThe primary goal is to safeguard Paytm s information and systems from damage, destruction, \nunauthorized disclosure, or modification, whether accidental or intentional. Additionally, Paytm s \ninformation systems must adhere to relevant laws, regulations, and contractual obligations. Paytm is \ndedicated to maintaining and continually enhancing its information security measures. \n7.1 What is Information \nInformation is the result of processing data in a way that adds to the knowledge of the receiver. \nInformation can exist in many forms. It can be printed or written on paper, stored electronically, \ntransmitted by post or by using electronic means, shown on films, or spoken in conversation. \n 7.2 What is Information Asset \nAn asset is anything that has value to an organization. Any information, like other important business \nassets, which has value to business, is Information Asset. Information Systems which help in \nprocessing, storing and disseminating information are also Information Assets. \n 7.3 What is Information Security \nInformation Security is protection of Information and Information Assets, from a wide range of threats \nto ensure business continuity and to minimize business risk thereby enhancing the return on \ninvestments. This is achieved by implementing a suitable set of controls, including policies, processes, \nprocedures, organizational structures and technology. These controls need to be established, \nimplemented, monitored, reviewed and improved to ensure that the specific security and business \nobjectives of the organization are met. This should be done in conjunction with other business \nmanagement processes. \n 7.4 Principles of Information Security \nInformation Security Program is based on the following principles: \na. Confidentiality: Protection of information by ensuring that information is accessible only to \nthose authorized. \nb. Integrity: Assuring the accuracy and completeness of information and its associated \ninformation processing methods and ensuring controls for preventing unauthorized \nmodification. \nc. Availability: Ensuring that information and associated assets or systems are available to \nauthorized users when required. \n 7.5 What is Information Security Risk Management \nAn Information Security Risk is the probability that an Information Asset will be subjected to loss, \ndestruction, unauthorized modification and or disclosure. \n6 \nInformation Security Risk Management pertains to protecting critical information reducing \nInformation Security Risk for Paytm, including associated corporate assets and services by: \na. Identification of security requirements and associated controls, based on a pre-defined \nassessment of Information Security Risks. \nb. Effective implementation of controls to minimize Information Security breach. \nc. Continuous monitoring review of controls to determine their effectiveness. \n 7.6 Information Security Objectives \nProtect Information and Systems: Ensure that Paytm s information and systems are safeguarded \nagainst damage, destruction, unauthorized access, and changes, whether they occur accidentally or \ndeliberately. \nCompliance: Ensure that Paytm s information systems comply with all applicable laws, \nregulations, and contractual obligations. \nContinuous Improvement: Maintain and continually improve Paytm s information security \npractices to adapt to evolving threats and standards. \n8. Ownership and Management \nTo avoid conflict of interest, formulation of policy and implementation compliance to the policy \nshould remain segregated. \nThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is responsible for articulating the IS Policy that \nPaytm uses to protect the information assets apart from coordinating the security related Issues \nwithin the organization as well as relevant external agencies. \nAll the employees and external parties as defined in policy are responsible for ensuring the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of Paytm s information assets. \nThe information security policy shall be approved by the Board if there are any changes or \namendments in the policy. \n9. Information Security Governance \nExecutive management acknowledges the importance of ensuring information security and is \ncommitted to supporting the information security goals and principles. \nPaytm should establish an Information security governance program, based on international \nstandards and globally accepted best practices like ISO 27001. \nCISO is accountable for Paytm s information security governance program and enforcement of this \npolicy. \nThe information security team is responsible for monitoring and reviewing Information Systems \nfor compliance with information security policies and producing regular management reports on \nthe status of information security. Team is also responsible for ensuring information security \npolicies are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary to ensure that they remain appropriate in \nthe case of any relevant changes to the law, organizational policies, or contractual changes. \nPaytm shall carry out comprehensive security risk assessment of their people, IT, business process \nenvironment, etc., to identify risk exposures with remedial measures and residual risks. \n7 \nReports on risk assessment, security compliance posture, security audit reports and security \nincidents shall be presented to the management. \nPaytm shall carry out and submit to the management annually, internal and annual external audit \nreports; annual Vulnerability Assessment Penetration Test (VAPT) reports. \n10. Information Security Requirement \nPaytm should follow a risk-driven methodology to minimize the security risk level for its processes \nand information assets, including (but not limited to) data, facilities, technology, application \nsystems and people. \nPaytm should develop and follow a detailed set of enforceable policies and procedures \ncommensurate with the criticality and sensitivity of information and processing facilities \nPaytm should apply all reasonable, appropriate, practical, and effective security measures to \nadequately protect its critical information and information processing facilities. \nPaytm should apply the necessary security controls required to meet its contractual, legislative, \nregulatory, privacy and ethical responsibilities. \nPaytm management must ensure that information security requirements are assessed and identified \nduring the initiation of every information system or service project. \nAny information system or service hosted or managed by Paytm should follow and comply with \nPaytm s information security policies and procedures. \nA standard Information Security Confidentiality Clause (including a Non-Disclosure Agreement) \nand relevant compliance obligations should be included in all agreements, contracts, and purchase \norders between Paytm, and any third party being granted access to confidential or sensitive data, \ninformation, and system. \nPaytm should ensure that it respects the intellectual property rights of any third party whose \nproducts are used for business purposes. \nPaytm should ensure continuity for critical business processes, in case of any disturbance, by \nimplementing proper business continuity disaster recovery plans and solutions. \nIt is the responsibility of all users to report any security related or suspected incidents to the \nInformation Security team. All breaches of information security should be reported to the \nInformation Security team and investigated by the appropriate staff, depending upon the type of \nbreach. \nAny violation, non-adherence to this policy should be considered seriously and should be liable for \ndisciplinary action that may include termination. \n11. Continual Improvement of Information Security Governance \nThe Information Security Policy should be reviewed and approved by the Board whenever there is \na change affecting the policy. \nThe Information Security Team should facilitate the overall policy review process. \nPaytm should define and establish responsibility for implementing and maintaining all relevant \ncompliance program across the environment. \n8 \nAll employees should have an acceptable level of security education and knowledge and be aware \nof their responsibilities towards information security. Therefore, the Information Security Team \nshould introduce various programs for security awareness. All employees should participate in the \nsecurity awareness programs during induction and annual basis. \nThe Information Security Team must deliver all approved and endorsed policies, standards, and \nprocedures to all employees via its official channel, in addition to other efficient channels. \n 12.

As a formal specification, it mandates\nrequirements that define how to implement, monitor, maintain, and\ncontinually improve the ISMS.\nNational Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST) SP\n800-53\nNIST SP 800-53 database represents the controls defined in NIST SP\n800-53 Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information\nSystems and Organizations.\nNIST SP 800-53r 5 Control Families\nRoles and Responsibilities\nDefine key roles and responsibilities to complete a task.\nRoles\nResponsibility\nAll RTI Staff\nComply with requirements set forth in this policy; acknowledge read\nand understand training.\nRTI Vendors and Contractors\nComply with requirements set forth in this policy; acknowledge read\nand understand training.\nChief Information Officer\nThe Chief Information Officer (CIO) is the company executive\nresponsible for the management, implementation, and usability of\ninformation and computer technologies.\nChief Information Security Officer\n(CISO)\nThe Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) is the executive\nresponsible for an organization s information and data security.\nOffice of the CISO\nThe Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) staff\nserve in a segregated role and are responsible for keeping up to date\non the latest IT compliance practices and regulatory requirements.\n The OCISO Managers and staff will assist to ensure that all network,\ndigital and information technology related activities of RTI and its\nPage 1 of 18\nstaff are conducted in agreement with RTI, the ISMS and IT Policies,\nProcedures and regulatory security compliance practices and\nstandards.\nGlobal Technology Solutions (GTS)\nResponsible for the governance of RTI s network, maintenance of the\ninfrastructure, and functionality of Corporate systems.\nDefinitions\nTerm Acronym\nDefinition\nDocument Management System\n(DMS)\nA system used to retrieve, track, manage and store documents.\nInformation Security Management\nSystem (ISMS)\nA set of policies concerned with information security management\nor IT related risks.\nIntroduction\nThis comprehensive Information Security Policy (ISP) provides information on the RTI IT prescribed\nmeasures used to establish and mandate the IT security program for compliance to both internal and external\ndata protection requirements.\nInformation Security is everyone s responsibility and to ensure an effective\nsecurity position is a team effort involving the participation and support of every RTI system user who\ninteracts with data and information systems. Therefore, it is the responsibility of every user to know this\npolicy and to conduct their activities accordingly.\nProtecting company information and the systems that collect, process, and store this information is of critical\nimportance. Consequently, the security of information systems must include controls and safeguards to offset\npossible threats and vulnerabilities, as well as controls to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\nthe data:\nConfidentiality Confidentiality addresses preserving restrictions on information access and\ndisclosure so that access is restricted to only authorized users and services.\nIntegrity Integrity addresses the concern that sensitive data has not been modified or deleted in an\nunauthorized and undetected manner.\nAvailability Availability addresses ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.\nSecurity measures must be taken to guard against unauthorized access to, alteration, disclosure or\ndestruction of data and information systems.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this policy is to highlight the company and regulatory requirements under which RTI staff\nshall operate and safeguard its data and information systems to both reduce risk and minimize the effect of\npotential incidents.\nImplementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) and consistent security controls within\nRTI helps the institute comply with obligations to ensure long term due diligence in protecting the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of RTI and client data.\nThis policy summarizes the comprehensive framework for:\nProtecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of RTI s data and related information systems.\nProtecting RTI, its employees, and its clients from unauthorized use of RTI owned and or managed\ninformation systems and data.\nPage 2 of 18\nEnsuring the effectiveness of security controls over data and information systems owned and or\nmanaged by RTI that support the Institute s operations.\nRecognizing the highly networked nature of the current computing environment and provide\neffective management and oversight of Information Security risks.\nScope\nThis policy applies to all RTI employees, vendors, contractors, sub-contractors, as well as all RTI-owned or IT\nAdministrator-managed data, information systems, activities, and assets owned, leased, controlled, or used by\nRTI. Any other systems, assets or activities not owned by RTI or maintained by RTI s IT Department, IT\nAdministrator, are not included in this policy. \nGeneral Information Security Controls\nThe RTI security control policies align with the National Institute of Technology (NIST) framework,\nwhich is updated accordingly, and have been developed to define a minimum level of security and\ncontrol across RTI. Any unauthorized exceptions to the ISMS and or standards will not be permitted.\nThese standards and the ISMS go into effect upon the initial publication of this document.\nBusiness Units may provide more rigorous security and control solutions and standards beyond what\nhas been required in the RTI 14.1 Network and Computing Security Policy and associated procedures.\nAll employees, contractors, and others who have access to RTI facilities and information assets must\nbe made aware of the ISMS, Acceptable Use, and security policies within 30 days of hire (for\nemployees) or prior to being given such access (for contractors) and at least annually thereafter.\nSecurity responsibilities will be specified in job descriptions, through RTI policies, procedures, and\ncontracts (as applicable), and compliance with RTI Information Security Awareness training will be\nmonitored and enforced by Office of the CISO in coordination with Enterprise Risk Management. For\nthe purposes of this statement, Security Awareness refers to employee s awareness of the\nInformation Security Management Systems (ISMS), Information Security policies, standards, and\npractices.\nSome network activities shall be monitored and logged to ensure compliance with the rules\nestablished in this and other IT policies, standards, procedures, and guidelines.\nExternal Regulations\nAny systems connected to the RTI network or that store RTI or Client data will meet applicable\nrequirements set forth by external regulations.  Such regulations may include but are not limited to:\nEAR and Export-controlled data\nFederal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)\n Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Health Information\nTechnology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH)\nValidated (GxP) Systems\nTitle 21 CFR Part 11 Electronic Signatures\nIf a client contractual requirement is more stringent than security baseline controls or regulatory\nmandates implemented at RTI, the contract will take precedence and IT Administrators must be\nnotified of the requirements.\nInformation Security and Classification of Electronic Information\nAll client and enterprise information held by RTI, and information contracted by RTI to be held by\nthird parties, are classified, and protected. The Office of the CISO creates and maintain standards\nregarding the use and disclosure of client and enterprise electronic information. RTI client and\nenterprise electronic information may only be used and disclosed for RTI business purposes.\nInformation obtained from or on behalf of RTI s clients, vendors or other third parties may be used\nPage 3 of 18\nand disclosed only as permitted by the contracts with, and representations made to those third\nparties. Please refer to the RTI Policy 14.2 Information Security and Classification of Electronic\nInformation and supporting procedures for the classification and handling of electronic data.\nIT Operations Management Security\nIT Administrators will create and maintain procedures that support this Policy and designate roles\nand responsibilities for the secure management and operation of all information processing facilities.\nThis includes the development of appropriate operating instructions. IT Administrators will:\nDeploy code controls adequate to detect and prevent the introduction of malicious software.\nDeploy controls to adequately protect exchanges of information and software with third\nparties to ensure the security of the transaction as well as compliance with applicable laws.\nEnact standards to protect information and media in transit as defined in IT standards.\nManage changes to the IT infrastructure to minimize the likelihood of outages and reduce the\nrisk of negatively impacting RTI s IT security posture.\nData protection considerations will be built into information systems and applications. This will\ninclude infrastructure, commercial products, and applications either developed internally or via\noutsourcing and client-facing applications hosted by both RTI and clients. All security requirements\nwill be identified and agreed to during the requirements -setting of a project and documented.\nAppropriate controls and audit trails or activity logs must be designed into application systems\nincluding the validation, authorization, and authentication of access controls. Additional controls\nmight be required for systems that process or have an impact on sensitive, valuable, or critical\norganizational assets.\nIT Administrators will incorporate cryptographic controls, when applicable, to protect the\nconfidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information. In addition, IT Administrators will provide\nadequate protections for source code and incorporate technical security testing into development\nprocesses, lifecycles, and quality assurance.\nIT Administrators will utilize change control, vulnerability scanning, security development, and\ntesting processes to ensure the security of the system(s) and the operating environment(s) are not\ncompromised. IT Administrators will implement and adhere to secure development practices and\nstandards as specified by applicable regulations and law to their line of business.\nLegacy RTI application products that have operationally survived longer than their capability to be\nsustained with relevant security patches and features to mitigate evolving threats will be sunset or\notherwise isolated from RTI s IT infrastructure.\nOffice of the CISO\nXX-1 controls, CM-10, AC-3, AU-9, AU-11, CP-9, MP-4, SA-5, SI-12, Appendix J\nPrivacy Controls, SI-12, AC-8, AU-6, CM-11, PL-4, PS-6, PS-8, IA-7, SC-13, CA-2, CA-7, RA-5,\nAU-1, AU-2, SI-4\nA.18.1.4, A.18.2.2\nThe Office of the Chief Information Security Officer (OCISO) promotes a culture of shared\nresponsibility to safeguard RTI by maturing the cybersecurity and resiliency of systems and\ninformation.

The LMS course will be the system of record for\nInformation Security Awareness training compliance for all employees and completion is\nrequired by all employees and contractors.\nIn addition to the awareness training, each employee contractor will be required to\ncomplete specific job-related training as appropriate to their role.\nEach employee or contractor will be required to complete the Information Security\nAwareness training on an annual basis after their first year.\nPage 7 of 18\nThe Awareness Training content will be updated annually to address new risks to the\norganization and may include a separate version for refresh training.\nEmployees might be required to complete additional job specific security training on an\nannual basis depending on their job function.\nThe Awareness and Training Procedures supports the implementation of and compliance\nwith this policy.\nPolicy: Audit and Accountability (AU)\n3.3.1-3.3.9\nAU-1 Audit and Accountability Policy\nAudit and Accountability\nThe purpose of the Audit and Accountability Policy is to ensure that major applications and general\nsupport systems are evaluated on a continual basis in accordance with OMB Circular A-130, FISMA\nand other applicable federal, state, and local guidelines. The quality and integrity of RTI s system\nmonitoring and auditing is used to determine if inappropriate actions, either intentional or\nunintentional, have occurred within an information system. System monitoring is used to look for\nthese inappropriate actions in real time while system auditing looks for them after the fact. Without\nsystem auditing and assigned accountability, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to determine when a\nfailure of the information system security, or a breach of the information systems itself has occurred,\nthe magnitude of the breach or failure, and the details of that breach or failure.\nEvent audit logs contain system generated audit records that contain information to\nestablish what events occurred on the system, the source(s) of the events, and the outcome\nof the events.\nIT Administrators will create, protect, and retain information system audit records to the\nextent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful,\nunauthorized, or inappropriate information system activity.\nIT Administrators will ensure that the actions of individual information system users can be\nuniquely traced to those users.\nAudited events will be reviewed and updated.\nIT Administrators will correlate audit review, analysis, and reporting processes for\ninvestigation and response to indications of inappropriate, suspicious, or unusual activity.\nAudit information and audit tools will be protected from unauthorized access, modification,\nand deletion.\nPolicy: Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring (CA)\n3.12.1 3.12.3\nCA-1 Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring Policy\nSecurity Assessment\nThe quality and integrity of RTI s security assessment is focused on determining the degree to which\ninformation system security controls are correctly implemented, whether they are operating as\nintended, and whether they are producing the desired level of security. Vulnerability assessment is\nfocused on determining the weaknesses inherent in the information systems that could be exploited,\nleading to an information system breach. Without security and vulnerability assessments, the\npotential exists that information systems may not be as secure as intended or desired.\nPage 8 of 18\nPeriodically assess the security controls in organizational information systems to determine\nif the controls are effective in their application.\nDevelop and implement plans of action designed to correct deficiencies and reduce or\neliminate vulnerabilities in organizational information systems.\nInformation system security controls with be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure the\ncontinued effectiveness of the controls.\nPolicy: Configuration Management (CM)\n3.4.1-3.4.9\nCM-1 Configuration Management Policy\nConfiguration Management\nThe quality and integrity of RTI s standardized configuration settings allow information systems and\ninformation system components to be consistently deployed in an efficient and secure manner.\nWithout standardized configuration settings, the potential exists that information systems may be\ndeployed that fail to meet the security requirements of RTI, or that compromise the security\nrequirements of other information systems with which they interconnect.\nConfiguration baselines and inventories will be established and maintained of organizational\ninformation systems (including hardware, software, firmware, and documentation)\nthroughout the respective system development lifecycles.\nEstablish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products\nemployed in organizational information systems.\nTrack, review, approve disapprove, and audit changes to RTI information systems.\nAnalyze the security impact of changes prior to implementation.\nDefine, document, approve, and enforce physical and logical access restrictions associated\nwith changes to the information system.\nIT Administrators will restrict, disable, and prevent the use of nonessential programs,\nfunctions, ports, protocols, and services.\nUser-installed software will be controlled and monitored.\nNetworks will be configured to restrict information flow between information systems or\ncomponents of information systems using access control lists.\nAn asset inventory of information system components will be maintained. The inventory will\nbe updated when a new information system or information system component is\nimplemented or an old one is retired.\nChange Management\nChange Management ensures that standardized methods and procedures are used for efficient and prompt\nhandling of all changes to control IT infrastructure, in order to minimize the number and impact\nof any related incidents upon service. All IT Administrators changes are executed in a\ndocumented and predictable manner so that Users can plan accordingly. All IT Administrator\nDivisions must follow the IT Change Management Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) which\nprovides the change management process for all production systems and associated resources.\nPage 9 of 18\nPolicy: Contingency Planning (CP)\nCP-1 Contingency Planning Policy\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that information security is properly addressed within the\norganization s Business Continuity Planning strategy. Business Continuity plans (BCP) and Disaster\nRecovery (DR) procedures shall be in place to ensure that effective compliance will be maintained\neven in periods of business disruption. RTI s Resilience Programs maintain two distinct functions\nincluding Incident Management and Business Continuity. The Incident Response and Contingency\nPlanning policies supports the implementation of and compliance with this policy.\nGTS is required to develop, implement, test and maintain an IT Business Continuity Plan covering all\nIT staff and Contingency Disaster Recovery Plans covering all supported networks that deliver or\nsupport core systems and services at RTI.\nDocument a BCP that addresses documented recovery strategies designed to enable RTI to\nrespond to potential disruptions.\nContingency plans will go through testing to ensure comprehensiveness and effectiveness.\nThese information security processes and controls will be reviewed and validated regularly\nto ensure their continued effectiveness.\nDevelop, maintain, and document data backup and storage procedures to ensure the\nrecovery of electronic information in the event of failure.\nIdentify and apply security requirements for protecting data backups based on the different\ntypes of data (e.g., sensitive, confidential, public) handled by the entity.\nPolicy: Identification and Authentication (IA)\n3.5.1-3.5.11\nIA-1 Identification and Authentication Policy\nIdentification and Authentication\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure IT Administrators have implemented controls within the\ninformation systems that uniquely identify and authenticate users and devices to ensure only those\nwho have a need to know have access to RTI and or client data.\nBasic Security Requirements:\nAuthenticate (or verify) the identities of those users, processes, or devices as a prerequisite\nto allowing access to organizational information systems.\nSaaS solutions managed by GTS will require Single Sign on (SSO) unless in conflict\nwith legal, regulatory or framework control requirements which will take\nprecedence.\nDerived Security Requirements:\nMultifactor authentication is used for local and network access to privileged\naccounts and for network access to non-privileged accounts.\nReplay-resistant authentication mechanisms are employed for network access to\nprivileged and non-privileged accounts.\nPrevent reuse of identifiers.\nDisable identifiers after a defined period of inactivity.\nImplement a minimum password complexity and change of characters when new password\ncreation is enforced.\nPage 10 of 18\nProhibit password reuse for a specified number of generations.\nTemporary password use for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent\npassword is required.\nStore and transmit only encrypted representation of passwords.\nObscure feedback of authentication information.\nCreate and maintain standards regarding the classification of client and enterprise\ninformation.\nCreate and maintain standards regarding the secure disposal of client and enterprise\ninformation assets.\nDispose of client and enterprise information in a secure fashion such that the information is\nnot readable or recoverable after disposal and certificates of destruction will be obtained and\nsaved where required.\nPolicy: Incident Response (IR)\n3.6.1-3.6.3\nIR-1 Incident Response Policy\nIncident Response\n5.2, 5.3, 7.5.1, 7.5.2, 7.5.3, A.5.1.1, A.5.1.2, A.6.1.1, A.12.1.1 A.18.1.1, A.18.2.2\nRTI has legal and contractual responsibilities to maintain and protect the confidentiality of all our\ncustomers information. In this respect it is the company s obligation to ensure employees,\ncontractors, consultants and temporary employees are aware of and adequately trained regarding\ncorporate security, privacy policies and standards.\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure that RTI s incident response capabilities, used to monitor for\nsecurity incidents have a maintained quality and integrity. The incident response capabilities\ndetermine the magnitude of the threat presented by these incidents, and how to respond to these\nincidents. Without an incident response capability, the potential exists that in the event that a\nsecurity incident occurs, it will go unnoticed, and the magnitude of harm associated with the incident\nwill be significantly greater than if the incident were noted and corrected.\nOCISO investigates and responds to any actual, threatened, suspected, or alleged security incident,\nincluding violation of RTI and IT security policies or a breach of information security safeguards\n(including any attempts to bypass, break through or override any information security safeguards).\nIncident reporting and notification is provided by OCISO to members of the incident response team,\nincluding the Privacy Office, Enterprise Risk Management, and others based on the nature of the\nevent. Investigations are performed by OCISO or in collaboration with the Privacy Office, Enterprise\nRisk Management, and or Corporate Counsel and representatives of certain business units if\napplicable.\nAn operational incident-handling capability is developed and implemented for all organizational\ninformation systems that house or access RTI controlled information.\nIncidents will be tracked, documented, and reported to appropriate officials and or authorities both\ninternal and external to the organization in coordination with the Privacy Office, Enterprise Risk\nManagement and Contracts Office.\nPolicy: System Maintenance (MA)\n7.1, 7.2\nMA-1 System Maintenance Policy\nMaintenance\nPage 11 of 18\nThe quality and integrity of RTI s information system maintenance is required to ensure that\ninformation systems are always operating optimally. Set maintenance processes are required to\nensure that maintenance is conducted in the most secure manner possible. System Maintenance has\nbecome a crucial discipline for enterprises. It enables enterprises to properly maintain the systems\nthey have come to rely on and ensure these systems continue to work and perform as expected.\nWithout systems maintenance, the potential exists that information systems will be unable to provide\nappropriate information security. Without maintenance processes, the potential exists that the act of\nperforming systems maintenance could, either directly or indirectly, compromise information system\nsecurity. IT Administrators are responsible for the maintenance of server network resources.\nPerform maintenance on organizational information systems.\nProvide effective controls on the tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel used to\nconduct information system maintenance.\nOnly pre-authorized personnel are allowed to perform information system maintenance.\nMultifactor authentication is required to establish nonlocal maintenance sessions via\nexternal network connections; terminate such connections when nonlocal maintenance is\ncomplete.\nRemote maintenance must be authorized, actively monitored, and audited upon completion.\nA maintenance log shall be maintained for all information system maintenance.\nMaintenance activities of maintenance personnel without required access authorization will\nbe supervised.\nPolicy: Media Protection (MP)\n3.8.1 3.8.9\nMP-1 Media Protection\nMedia Protection\nThe quality and integrity of RTI s media protection mechanisms allow information to be provided a\ngreater level of security than can be achieved with system-based protection mechanisms alone.\nWithout media protection mechanisms, the potential exists that RTI s information assets could be\nexposed to an unnecessarily high level of risk, particularly in circumstances where that information is\ntaken out of the information system. IT Administrators are responsible for the protection of media\ncontaining RTI corporate or client data and in ensuring that access is properly controlled during\nstorage and transportation.\nAll privileged information when stored out of system (via information media) will be\nprotected by media protection mechanisms to ensure the highest levels of security.\nNon-privileged information will be protected to ensure the highest levels of integrity and\navailability.\nWhere information is transferred to media, that media shall be stored securely within a\ncontrolled area and access to that controlled area shall be physically restricted to authorized\npersonnel. Further, the mechanisms that enforce those access restrictions shall collect access\ninformation and shall include the ability to audit access attempts.\nInformation system media will be sanitized or destroyed before disposal or release for reuse.\nCryptographic mechanisms shall be implemented to protect the confidentiality of data stored\non digital media during transport unless otherwise protected by alternative physical\nsafeguards.\nPage 12 of 18\nUse of non-IT managed external devices (e.g., USB, network based) for workstations is not\npermitted.  If an exception is granted, then the drive must be encrypted\nPolicy: Clean Desk\nA Clean Desk Policy for workspaces is also required to ensure that all sensitive and confidential\ninformation, whether on paper, storage media, or hardware is properly secured and protected from\nunauthorized view.\nUsers must ensure that all sensitive or confidential data in hardcopy is removed from their\nworkspace and secured in a drawer when the desk is unoccupied at the end of the workday.\nFile cabinets containing sensitive or confidential information must be kept closed and locked\nwhen not in use or when left unattended.\nPrintouts containing sensitive or confidential information should be immediately removed\nfrom the printer. Sensitive or confidential documents must also be shredded upon disposal.\nWhiteboards containing sensitive or confidential data must be thoroughly erased.\nStorage devices when not in use such as CD, DVD, hard drives, USB drives, etc. containing sensitive or\nconfidential data must be secured in a drawer and data must be encrypted.\nPolicy: Physical and Environmental Security (PE)\n3.10.1 3.10.6\nPE-1 Physical and Environmental Protection Policy\nPersonnel Security\nThe purpose of this policy is to ensure proper measures are in place to prevent unauthorized physical\naccess or damage to the organization s information and facilities. IT Administrators will create and\nmaintain physical security controls within established standards to prevent unauthorized access to,\ndamage to, interference of, and unauthorized use of facilities and information. Controls, dependent\nupon established and Environmental Security Standards for specific Business Units, may include\naccess control, alarm monitoring, video surveillance, and the deployment of security officers. The\nprotection provided by physical security controls will be commensurate with the classification and\nmethod of information stored, processes performed, and identified environmental and physical risks\nat each RTI location.\nRTI Global Security and GTS will develop, approve, and maintain a list of personnel\nwith authorized access to the facility where information systems are physically\nlocated.\nRTI Security and GTS will establish a process to review, approve, and issue\ncredentials for facility access.\nRTI Security and GTS shall remove individuals from the facility access list when\naccess is no longer required.\nAudit logs of physical access will be maintained.\nRTI staff will escort visitors and monitor visitor activity.\nRTI Security and GTS will control and manage physical access devices.\nEquipment shall be physically protected from security threats and environmental hazards.\nEquipment security requirements shall also address unauthorized access to and safeguarding\nsupporting facilities utilities, such as the electrical supply and cabling infrastructure.

Corporation s e-Tools, and the information, including data they contain, are fundamental for its daily \noperations and effective service provision. In this regard, ISO 27001 (formally known as ISO IEC \n27001:2005) stipulates international standards for any organization to protect their data, information or \nassets etc., from any possible informational loss breach or from cyber-attacks. ISO 27001 is a specification \nfor an Information Security Management System (ISMS). An ISMS is a framework of policies and \nprocedures that includes all legal, physical and technical controls involved in an organization s \ninformation risk management processes. \n2. Accordingly, Corporation aims to implement adequate security guidelines, procedures and controls to \nprotect confidentiality, maintain integrity, and ensure availability of all information stored, processed and \ntransmitted through its information systems. \n3. Information Security Procedures outlines the overall direction and intent on implementation of controls \nfor integrity, confidentiality and availability of information and information assets. \n4. These security procedures applies to any person (such as employees, system administrator or in-charge, \nusers, auditors, contractors, consultants, outsourced vendors, third parties and others) who access or use \nCorporation s information information systems. \n5. While Corporation would like to respect privacy of its employees, it reserves the right to audit and or \nmonitor the activities of its employees and information stored, processed, transmitted or handled by the \nemployees using Corporation s information systems. \n6. With the implementation of these procedures, it shall be stipulated that Corporation is committed to \nmaintain robust security practices and controls to preserve confidentiality, integrity and availability of \ninformation assets by optimal processes, technology and trained personnel from all threats, whether \ninternal or external, deliberate or accidental. \n7. The instructions are to be implemented across PAN India. Corporation is also using 46 e-Tools. The \nCorporation is going first time for the ISO 27001 Certification therefore MIS Division every year shall \nlook into these policies and procedures in terms of implementation and latest updates required as per the \nlatest security standards and guidelines issued by Cert-In and any other government bodies. \n8. The overall objective of this Information Security is to ensure: \n8.1. Information is available and usable when required and the systems that provide it can appropriately \nresist and recover from failures (Availability) \n8.2. Information is observed by or disclosed to only those who have right to know. (Confidentiality) \n173\n1408\n8.3. Information is protected against un-authorized modification (Integrity) \n8.4. Protecting information against un-authorized access (Access Control) \n8.5. Business transactions as well as information exchanges between Corporation s different locations or \nwith partners users can be trusted (Authenticity and non-repudiation) \n9. Corporation and all employees of Corporation shall be committed in true spirit for compliance of ISMS in \naccordance with the set documented procedures as per ISO 27001:2013. \n10. Approval for exceptions or deviations from the procedures, wherever warranted, will be provided only by \nCompetent Authority. \n11.

Title: SOP for Clear Screen and Clear Desk \n7.1 Clear Screen Procedures and Guidelines \n7.1.1 When away from place of work, laptop desktop user shall ensure that the system is locked. \nLocking computer screen not only prevents someone else from using that PC, which is already \nlogged on, but it also prevents someone from reading confidential information left open on the \nscreen. \n7.1.2 All desktop and laptop screen shall be configured to lock out when inactive beyond a threshold \nlimit of a defined number of minutes of inactivity. \n7.1.3 If working on sensitive information, and you have a visitor to your desk, lock the screen to prevent \nthe contents being read. \n7.2 Clean Desk Procedures and Guidelines \n7.2.1 All employees at CWC shall be responsible for ensuring important business information in their \ncustody (both paper and digital media) are kept securely and are inaccessible to unauthorized \naccess until their disposal. \n7.2.2 At the end of each day, or when desks offices are unoccupied, any confidential information must \nbe locked away in filing cabinets or offices, as appropriate. The key to the filing cabinets or offices, \nas appropriate should be maintained securely at all times. \n7.2.3 All waste paper, which has any personal or confidential information or data, must be torn properly \nor shredded. Sensitive documents that are no longer needed must be disposed securely. It is \nrecommended to use a paper shredder for this purpose. \n7.2.4 All business documents including digital media such as CDs and DVDs etc. shall be secured in \nlocked cabinets when not in use or when left unattended, especially after working hours. \n7.2.5 CDs DVDs with information that are not required by the user must be shredded. \n7.2.6 Confidential and Restricted information, when printed, shall be cleared from printers immediately. \n7.2.7 All fax machines and printers shall be protected from unauthorized access. \n7.2.8 When transmitting sensitive facsimile message, users are advised to inform the recipient of the \nfacsimile first before transmission. \n7.2.9 When receiving sensitive facsimile message users must be physically present to receive the same. \n7.2.10 Users must not leave such papers unattended on printer trays, photocopiers, fax machines or their \ndesks. Users must collect the printouts from the printer trays promptly. \n7.2.11 Portable devices such as laptops, mobiles or PDAs shall not be left unattended and shall be locked \nwhen not in use. \n7.2.12 Users must ensure the confidentiality and integrity of information that they deal with or is made \navailable to them in day-to-day operations. \n199\n1434\n8. Title: SOP for Cryptography \n8.1 \nData Encryption \n8.1.1 CWC shall incorporate cryptographic controls to achieve the following information security \nobjectives: \n8.1.1.1 Confidentiality of sensitive or critical information, either stored or transmitted \n8.1.1.2 Integrity Authenticity of stored or transmitted sensitive or critical information \n8.1.1.3 Non repudiation of occurrence non-occurrence of an event or action \n8.1.1.4 Secure Authentication of users and other system entities \n8.1.1.5 Data over third-party networks - Any data traveling over third-party networks and \ncommunication backbone must be encrypted wherever possible. \n8.2 \nEncryption of confidential restricted information \n8.2.1 Confidential restricted information transmitted over any communication network must be sent \nin an encrypted form. \n8.2.2 Confidential information not being actively used, when stored or transported in computer-\nreadable storage media (such as servers, magnetic tapes, floppy disks or CDs), must be in \nencrypted form wherever possible. \n8.2.3 To prevent unauthorized disclosure of data when computers are sent out for repair or used by \npersonnel, other than the normal users within or outside the Corporation, all data stored on hard \ndisks must be encrypted. \n8.2.4 The strength of the encryption algorithm to be used in a given situation must be based on the \nclassification of the data to be encrypted. \n8.2.5 Certifying Authority - CWC shall use only those Digital Certificate issued by Certifying \nAuthorities registered with Controller of Certifying Authorities of Government of India. \n8.3 Managing electronic keys \nElectronic keys are used to encrypt and decrypt messages or digital signatures on messages sent \nbetween one or more parties. The management of the electronic keys is critical if confidentiality, \nauthenticity and integrity are to be preserved. Therefore, a procedure for the management of electronic \nkeys, to control both the encryption and decryption of sensitive documents or digital signatures, must \nbe established to ensure the adoption of best practice guidelines and compliance with both legal and \ncontractual requirements. Information security issues to be considered when implementing a procedure \ninclude the following: \n8.3.1 Digital Signature issued by licensed Certifying Authorities (CA) under Controller of Certifying \nAuthority (CCA) should only be used. \n8.3.2 Keys need to be communicated by reliable and secure methods and kept confidential. \n200\n1435\n8.3.3 If a private key becomes compromised, invalid messages could be sent which forge the identity \nof CWC. Such security breaches could result in substantial fraud. A process to cancel \ncompromised keys to prevent their further use is therefore required. \n8.3.4 Failure to manage the keys of the various senders of encrypted data may result in a failure to \ndecrypt an incoming message, with potential costly delays. \n8.3.5 Security risks (e.g., of damage, theft) may vary considerably between locations and this should \nbe taken into account when determining the most appropriate security measures. \n8.4 Using and Receiving electronic signatures \nWhen using digital signatures, consideration should be given to any relevant legislation that describes \nthe conditions under which a digital signature is legally binding. Information security issues to be \nconsidered when implementing procedures include the following: \n8.4.1 Even signed documents cannot be relied upon unless the keys being used are trustworthy. \n8.4.2 Relying upon unsigned email, whilst acceptable in many circumstances, carries a risk, as source \nand destination fields can be readily forged. \n8.4.3 Receiving email via unsecured public lines (e.g., the internet) can compromise the \nconfidentiality and integrity of the contents. \n8.4.4 Important email communications might not be authenticated, which could result in un-\nauthorized instructions being issued. \n201\n1436\n9. Title: SOP for Compliances \n9.1 \nLicensing \n9.1.1 All information processing systems used in the CWC shall comply with the licensing terms or \nthe agreement executed between vendor CWC. \n9.1.2 CWC may use Commercial Software, Software under the open source license and Evaluation \nSoftware. \n9.1.3 Appropriate asset registers for the software shall be used in the CWC along with proof and \nevidence of ownership of licenses, master disks, manuals, etc. shall be maintained by the MIS \nDivision. \n9.1.4 Periodic checks shall be carried out using appropriate tools to detect unauthorized software in \nthe Corporation. \n9.1.5 CWC would not consider using Sharewares.

Social Media and Internet Postings \nPolicy Set Overview \nThe Information Security and Technology Policy ( Policy ) is dedicated to the following purposes. First, the \nPolicy is to convey the highest directive of cybersecurity posture of the City of Chicago ( City ) which stems to \na subset of administrative, operational, and technical controls. Second, the Policy is developed, reviewed, \nupdated, and implemented to mitigate imminent and potential cybersecurity risks to employees and affiliated \nthird parties on data, network and information system owned by the City. Third, the Policy guides how the City \ncomplies with applicable industry standards and regulations including the Health Information Portability and \nAccountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Illinois State Local Records Act (LRA), the Illinois State Breach \nDisclosure Laws, and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), Criminal Justice \nInformation System (CJIS), American Water Works Association (AWWA). \nPolicies, Standards, Guidelines and Procedures Defined \nA Policy consists of high-level statements relating to the protection of information across the organization \nand should be produced and ratified by senior management. A documented policy is frequently a \nrequirement to satisfy regulations or laws, such as those relating to privacy and finance. It is an \norganizational mandate. \nStandards consist of specific low level mandatory controls that help enforce and support the information \nsecurity policy. Standards help to ensure security consistency across the business and usually contain \nsecurity controls relating to the implementation of specific technology, hardware, or software. \nGuidelines consist of recommended, non-mandatory controls that help support standards or serve as a \nreference when no applicable standard is in place. Guidelines should be viewed as best practices that are \nnot usually requirements but are strongly recommended. They could consist of additional recommended \ncontrols that support a standard or help fill in the gaps where no specific standard applies. \nProcedures consist of step-by-step instructions to assist workers in implementing the various policies, \nstandards, and guidelines. While the policies, standards and guidelines consist of the controls that should \nbe in place, a procedure gets down to specifics, explaining how to implement these controls in a step-by-\nstep fashion. \nPolicy Set Structure \nTo ensure that best practices are woven into the City s technology infrastructure, the policy set is built off of \nindustry standard framework: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) \n800-53 Revision 5. \nFurthermore, to satisfy multiple external legal and compliance requirements, such as Payment Card Industry \nData Security Standard (PCI-DSS), the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and \nthe State of Illinois Local Records Act, specific requirements have been included. \nEach Policy Standard has been noted with the specific framework requirements to enable rapid cross \nreference of City Policy against compliance requirements. \nEach document consists of four level of hierarchical statements: Policy Number (Chapter, Numeric) Article \n(Numeric) Clause (Numeric) Item (Alphabetic). \nApplicability \nThe policies apply to all City of Chicago information technology systems and networks, those entrusted to \nthird-parties, City employees and others including but not limited to contractors, vendors and consultants. \nNot all departments in the City have the same technological implementations. While the policies reflect current \ntechnology and security advances, implemented technologies in some departments may not be of immediate \ncompliance with the policy. Use of such technologies must be reviewed by the Chief Information Security \nOfficer and approved by the Chief Information Officer through a policy exception process. \nThese policies do not foresee any exceptional situations like new legal or regulatory obligations, best \npractices, or emergencies that require actions that might conflict with policy statements. Should that occur, it \nis the responsibility of the individual who has identified such a situation to report to the Chief Information \nPolicy 1 \n1. Policy Responsibilities Oversight \nThe purpose of the Information Security Policy is to formalize the Security and Internal Control standards that the City of \nChicago ( City ) has adopted to mitigate security risks to employee and constituent data. The requirements and standards \nwithin this policy comply with applicable external controls and regulations, including the Health Information Portability \nand Accountability Act (HIPAA), Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, the \nPayment Card Industry s Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS), the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), the Illinois State \nLocal Records Act (LRA) and the Illinois State Breach Disclosure Laws. \nIn addition, this policy defines the requirements for how computing and communication assets, systems and resources \nshould be accessed, configured, used and protected. These requirements, along with monitoring activities of City \npersonnel s internet use help maintain the security of the City s technology environment. \nThis document is published under the authority of the Chief Information Officer, and provides a framework for \nsafeguarding data, including personally identifiable information (PII), protected health information (PHI) and payment \ncardholder data (CHD), throughout the information lifecycle within the City of Chicago. \nAll City Departments are subject to the provisions within.

Control of Operational Software \nOperational software should be an authorized version supported by the vendor, where applicable, and configured \nsecurely. Detailed controls guideline can be found on Process 5. \n5.3.2. Protection of Live Data in Test Environments \nData classified as private or higher used in any non-production environment should be altered or obfuscated. Detailed \nguidelines can be found on Process 5. \nPolicy 6 \n6. Data and Asset Classification \nA risk-based information data and computer asset classification scheme has been established in order to \nensure that data is handled and managed appropriately. Data and computer assets are to be classified in a \nmanner that indicates the need, priorities, and expected degree of protection appropriate to the nature of the \ndata and the potential impact of misuse. \n6.1. Responsibility for computer and Information Assets \nComputer and information ( data ) assets are to be accounted for and have an assigned owner. Acceptable use of City \nassets should be understood by employees and contingent staff. \n6.1.1. Ownership of Computer Assets and Data \nUnless specifically identified and approved by the Department of Law, information possessed or used by a particular \ndepartment and information stored and processed over the City s technology and information systems are the property \nof the City and are to have a designated Data Owner. City employees and contingent staff have no expectation of privacy \nassociated with the information they store in or send through these systems, within the limits of the federal, state and \nlocal laws of the United States and, where applicable, foreign laws. \nPhysical computing assets should have an assigned Asset Owner. \nProduction information possessed or used by a particular organization or business unit within the organization is to \nhave a designated Data Owner. Ownership and custodianship of assets is to be documented. \n6.1.2. Data Governance \nThe accountability and responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of City owned and \nmanaged data should be defined. \nThe below Table 1 provides definitions of the three defined data roles. The Department of Innovation and \nTechnology and the Department of Law are responsible for developing the roles and responsibilities for proper \ndata handling procedures. \nTable 1 Data Roles and Responsibilities Definition \nData Owner \nThe individual(s), normally a manager or director, who has accountability and responsibility for \nthe integrity, accurate reporting and use of computerized data. This individual(s) typically exist \nwithin the department that generated the data and is ultimately accountable for its accuracy \nand proper handling. \nData Custodian \nThe individual(s) and department(s) responsible for the storage, safeguarding and availability \nof computerized data. The Department of Innovation and Technology is a primary Custodian \nwithin the City. \nData Consumer \nThe individual(s) and department(s) that use provided data to perform a job responsibility \nincluding the possible generation of new data. A data consumer may also be a data custodian \nif that person transfers data from its original location. \nExample: If an employee or contingent worker transfers data from a server or website to their \nworkstation, that individual is not only a consumer but also a custodian of that data and is \nresponsible for its proper handling. \n6.1.3. Acceptable use of Computer Assets \nThe acceptable use of resources, information and assets should be documented and understood by staff (see \nAcceptable Use and Personnel Security Policy). Use of these resources is intended for business purposes in accordance \nwith individual job function and responsibilities. Personal use which is limited and in accordance with the City s Ethics \nOrdinance, Personnel Rules and other Applicable Use policies is permitted. The limited personal use of information \ntechnology resources is not permissible if it creates a non-negligible expense to the City, consumes excessive time, or \nviolates departmental policy. The privilege of limited personal use may be revoked or limited at any time by the City or \nDepartment officials. \nThe Information Security Office is responsible for defining acceptable use of resources, information and assets \nincluding appropriate labeling and handling procedures. In the absence of specific guidance, Data Owners and \nDepartment Management are primarily responsible for developing recommendations and minimum standards. \nAn up-to-date list of technologies as approved coordinated by Technical Operations and Enterprise Network \nArchitecture should be maintained and readily available. \n6.1.4. Inventory of Computer Assets \nAn inventory of information assets, including systems, software, and service providers, is to be always kept current. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should compile and maintain a data repository catalog \non third party software-related assets (e.g., application software, development tools and third party purchased \nsoftware). This catalog should be reviewed and updated annually. The catalog should contain descriptive asset \ninformation (e.g., vendor, logical locations associated applications or systems, physical location (if applicable), \nowner responsible party, information custodial responsibilities, information classification and criticality level). \nBusiness leaders are to assist in maintaining this catalog and should communicate any changes or additions. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should compile and maintain a data repository catalog \nof physical assets owned by the City. This catalog should be reviewed and updated annually. The catalog should \ncontain descriptive asset information. Business unit managers should assist Technical Operations and Enterprise \nNetwork Architecture in maintaining this catalog and should communicate changes or additions in a timely manner. \n6.2. Information and Data Classification \nInformation classification is based on the level of sensitivity of the data and the potential impact of inappropriate \nhandling should the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information or data compromised. A classification \nscheme, which establishes the baseline security controls for safeguarding information, should be used to ensure \nappropriate security protections are placed around information during handling. \n6.2.1. Information and Data Classification Guidelines \nAn information classification scheme should be used throughout the organization to protect City of Chicago s assets. \nThe Information Security Office is responsible for defining the Information Data Classification scheme. \nInformation Technology Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture is responsible for management oversight \nof information assets and should define procedures for proper data identification and handling. \nData Owners or an assigned Data Custodian is responsible for defining the classification of an information asset. \nIt is the Data Owner or delegated Data Custodian s responsibility to monitor information assets and continuously \nreview the information s classification. The Data Owner or delegated Data Custodian should sponsor a formal \ndeclassification effort before information can be downgraded to a lower classification, based upon the definitions \nof the classification. \nEmployees, contractors, and vendors should protect all of the City s information in any format (e.g., hard copy, disk, \ntape, flash drive) at the level commensurate with its value as determined by its information classification. These \nstandards mitigate the risk that information of different classification levels be inadvertently combined and \nreleased. Correctly classified information with proper controls can be instituted to manage the dissemination of \ninformation throughout the City s environment. \n6.2.2. Information and Data Classification Scheme \nThe City has a four-tier classification system consisting of Public, Internal , Sensitive and Confidential levels \nof classification. \nPublic Information is defined as information that is intended for unrestricted public disclosure and is not exempt \nfrom disclosure under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). \nExamples include open datasets, announcements, employment advertisements, press releases and marketing \nmaterials. \nInternal Information is defined as information that is related to the day-to-day operations of City departments and \nservices. All data classified as Internal is subject to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and if disclosed \nwould have minimal to no impact on the confidentiality, integrity or availability of City data or computer assets. \nExamples include most business documents, minutes of meetings, emails and data related to how City services \nare developed and delivered. \nSensitive information is defined as information that in isolation may not present any specific risk to the \nconfidentiality, integrity or availability of City operations, resources or constituents but if combined with other data \ncould represent inappropriate risk. Sensitive information can be exempt from the Illinois Freedom of Information \nAct (FOIA). FOIA exempt information must be approved by the Department of Law. \nExamples include internet protocol (IP) addresses of computer assets, design and procedure documents. \nConfidential information is defined as information that if lost, disclosed, or inappropriately modified could have \nsignificant impact to the confidentiality, integrity, availability of City operations, resources or constituents. Prior to \ndesignation, the Confidential classification must be approved by the Department of Law. Confidential information \nmay be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). \nExamples include information related to the City s Information Security (aka Cyber Security) controls, strategic \nplanning, operational means and methods, network diagrams, passwords, Card Holder Data (CHD) as defined \nunder PCI, Personal Health Information (PHI), Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and all other legally \nprotected material. \n6.2.3. Information and Data Labeling and Handling \nMedia must be labeled with its information classification to ensure the proper security controls are placed around the \nmedia while handling. \nData Owners are responsible for ensuring that removable media containing non-Public data is labeled with its \ninformation classification, owner, contact information and purpose. \nTechnology Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture is responsible for ensuring that efforts are made to \nseparate Confidential information from other information with specific security or control requirements. \nEmployees are responsible for ensuring that any electronic information approved for deletion from computer \nsystems and discarded hard copy documents are destroyed in a manner to protect disclosure of the information to \nexternal parties commensurate with the information s business value or confidentiality. \nData Owners or designated Data Custodians are responsible for ensuring that Confidential information is \nsecured in one of the following ways: \nHard copy information must be kept in an access-controlled room which is secured when unoccupied or \nwithin locked file cabinets with limited access if a secured room is not available; and \nElectronic information must be encrypted using an Information Security Office approved method when stored \non any portable device or media (e.g., laptop, hard drive, tape, compact disc, flash drive). \n6.2.4. Information and Data Management \nTo help ensure legal and information security control of City and constituent information, data at rest must remain \nwithin the physical boarders of the United States. \nData Owners are responsible to ensure that no City owned data is forwarded to non-US locations unless as part \nof approved business operations which has prior approval from the Information Security Office. \nNIST 800-53, FedRAMP \nData Owners, in partnership with the Departments of Innovation and Technology, Procurement Services, and \nLegal must ensure that contracts with third parties, who may come in contact with City data, meet or exceed \nNIST 800-53 and or FedRAMP-moderate level security controls. \nIII. Revision History \nPolicy 7 \nAccess Control \nCity of Chicago ( City ) employees should be positively authenticated and authorized prior to gaining access to \ncomputer assets. Access controls must be in place to ensure that information access is provided on a \nminimum necessary, as needed basis. Appropriate access controls should be implemented commensurate to \nthe sensitivity and risks assumed by the storage of data. \n7.1. Business Requirements for Access Control \nProper access controls should be placed around City computer assets and limited to only those persons whose jobs \nrequire such access. Asset access should be properly documented and granted only when required. Access to data \nmust be made through a formal request process. \n7.1.1. Access Control Policy \nAccess to information to City of Chicago system components should be documented and restricted. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture is responsible for ensuring that physical and logical \naccess controls are established. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture is responsible for ensuring that access rights granted and \nrevoked from systems are approved using an authorization form signed by Application Owners. Access rights granted \nto systems must be limited to the minimum access rights necessary for the user to fulfill their responsibilities as \ndetermined by their role. Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should document user access \nauthorization and approval for requested privileges via a service ticket or an access request form (ARF), which must \nbe retained in accordance with organization retention policies. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that each user is authorized to use the \nsystem for which access is granted, and that user IDs passwords should be implemented in accordance within the \nscope of the authorization. \nFor users with similar duties, groups or role-based access controls (RBAC) should be used to assign access to \nindividual accounts based on job descriptions, duties or function \nThe Information Owner should work with Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture to remove access \nto information as soon as that access is no longer needed. It is the responsibility of both the Information Owner and \nthe employee s Manager to see that access privileges are aligned with the needs of the business, assigned on a need-\nto-know basis, and the proper access lists of authorized users are communicated. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that access to confidential data is \nadministered via an automated access control system. \ng. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that access to computer systems is \ncontrolled by an authentication method involving a minimum of a username and password combination. The \nusername and password combination provides verification of the user s identity. Based on risk and compliance \nrequirements, two-factor authentication or better should be implemented. \nh. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that an access control mechanism is \nestablished for system components with multiple users that restricts access based on a user s need to know, and \nshould be set by default to deny all unless specifically allowed. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that there is a default deny-all setting on \ntechnical platforms. Administration accounts or accounts that can override system or application controls must be \nbased upon job function and necessity. These privileges should only be allocated on a need-to-have basis. \nDepartments should use the access request process to immediately notify the Department of Innovation and \nTechnology of a change in employment status (such as when a User takes a leave of absence, transfers \ndepartments, or is terminated). The account of a User on a leave of absence can be retained, suspended, or \ndeleted at the discretion of the User s department. \n7.2. User Responsibilities \nCity employees and all third parties working on behalf of the City must maintain a clear working environment to avoid \ntheft of information or information systems. \n7.2.1. Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy \nSpecial controls for office equipment must be in place (e.g., password-protected screensavers, cable-locks on portable \ndesktop equipment). \nUsers should ensure that private hardcopy information is kept in a secure, locked location \nwhen unattended. \nUsers should ensure that incoming and outgoing mail points, facsimile machines and photocopiers are protected \nagainst unauthorized use or interception. \nUsers should ensure that passwords are not written down or stored on information systems in an unprotected \nform. Users must not hard code any username passwords in scripts or clear text files such as system shell \nscripts, batch jobs or word processing documents. \n7.2.2. Password Use \na. User IDs and accounts which permit access to any computer resource (e.g. e-mail, server, network, etc.), should \nbe password protected. New accounts will be created with a temporary password. The temporary password \nshould be changed upon first use. \nb. Mobile devices should be password protected; this includes but is not limited to personal digital assistants \n(PDA), smart phones, laptops, desktops, tablets, handhelds (e.g. Blackberries, smartphones, etc.). \nc. Passwords should not be disclosed to anyone. \nd. Group passwords and or shared passwords are explicitly prohibited. \ne. All passwords are to be treated as Confidential information. \n7.3. User Identification \nCity system users, including third party users, should have a unique identification number and be registered on the \nsystems they use to conduct business. Additionally, default accounts should be removed from systems to avoid \npotentially unwanted access. \n7.3.1. User Registration \nUsers should follow registration procedures (e.g., obtain a user id, change the default password, etc.) prior to accessing \na new system. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that user registration, modification, and de-\nregistration procedures are implemented for user access rights on information systems. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure the initial passwords are unique. Initial \npasswords should meet City password composition standards. The user should be forced to change their password \nupon initial logon, and user credentials should never be provided via insecure communication methods (e.g. email, \ninstant messaging, etc.) \n7.3.2. User Identification \nUsers should provide unique user identification prior to gaining access to City of Chicago information assets. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that access to non-Public classified \ndata (see Data and Asset Classification Policy)be controlled by an approved authentication method (e.g. ID and \nPassword). \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that City employees have their own \nunique username for access to City network and systems. Individual or group sharing of usernames and \npasswords is strictly prohibited. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that legacy group user IDs may only be \nused if there is a clear business case and are approved by both the Information Owners and the Information \nSecurity Office. The Information Owners must be aware of the risks associated with using group IDs such as the \nloss of individual accountability. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure the users are limited to only one user \naccount for each individual information system for non-administrative purposes. Any deviations from this, \nincluding application or special use accounts, should be approved by the Information Security Office. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that users that have access to privileged \naccounts have their own personal accounts for normal business use. Normal user accounts must be used to \naccess accounts that cannot be tracked, such as shared super user or privileged accounts. Shared super user or \nprivileged accounts should not be logged into directly if their usage cannot be tracked. \n7.3.3. Default Accounts \nDefault, system, and non-user accounts should be safeguarded to prevent unauthorized access to City information \nassets. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure the default vendor passwords are \nchanged immediately following installation. \n7.3.4. Third Party Account \nAdditional security measures should be implemented to monitor the use of contractor or vendor accounts and ensure \nthe ongoing security of City information assets. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that any accounts used by contractors or \nvendors are only activated during the time period needed to complete the current maintenance task. \n7.4. Authentication \nAuthentication to City information systems should be governed by strong password composition guidelines in addition to \nstrong session level controls, logging and audit capabilities \n7.4.1. Password Standards \nPassword standards for construction and sharing should be properly documented and enforced. \nSecurity awareness training should communicate password procedures and policies to City of Chicago \nemployees. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture and Application Development should ensure that \nspecific procedures are implemented to verify a user s identity prior to conducting a password reset. Where a user \nrequests a password reset by phone, email, web, or other non-face-to-face method, appropriate user verification \npractices will be employed before the password is reset. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that computers, databases, and \napplications that store user account and password information restrict access only to authorized operations \npersonnel and that password information is rendered unreadable during transmission and storage on \nsystem components using strong cryptography based on approved standards. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should ensure that information systems use \npassword history techniques to maintain a password history of users. The history file should contain the \nlast 4 passwords of users and store them in an encrypted form. Users should not be allowed to use a \npassword contained within specific user s password history. \nUsers should be forced to change passwords at least every ninety (90) days. Technical Operations and \nEnterprise Network Architecture should enforce this through technical means by enabling password aging \ncontrols on systems. \n7.4.2. Inactive Accounts \nThe City should implement specific procedures to ensure that inactive accounts are disabled or deleted in a timely \nmanner. Accounts that meet the criteria noted below may be disabled or deleted without warning. \n7.4.3. Session Restrictions \nComputer sessions that are not being actively used automatically terminate or lockout. \n7.4.4. Secure Network Controls \nNetwork access controls should be implemented to ensure only authorized devices are allowed to access the \nCity s network. \nNon-City owned computer assets are not permitted to use or connect to the City s private, enterprise network. \nExceptions can only be granted by Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture. Exceptions must be \ndocument and renewed every six (6) months. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture should implement network access control technologies \nwithin the PCI environment to limit access to the City of Chicago Network to only authorized systems and \nprocesses. \n7.4.5. Secure System Login \nControls should be in place to ensure the security of user credentials and the identity of the organization are \nsafeguarded throughout the login process. \n7.5. Authorization \nAuthorized users should be authenticated before granting access to any City system. Information systems should \nbe reviewed regularly to ensure proper authorization for access. \n7.5.1. Review of User Access Rights \nInformation Owners are responsible for reviewing system privileges on a periodic basis and are to promptly revoke \nor amend privileges no longer required by users. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture and Information Owners should ensure that privileges \nassigned to employees transferring or changing job responsibilities are reviewed and re-allocated as determined \nby their new role. \nTechnical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture and Information Owners should ensure that special or \nprivileged access to systems (such as administrative or supervisor accounts) are reviewed quarterly. Any changes \nmade to privileged accounts should be logged and periodically reviewed. \nInformation Owners are responsible for reviewing system privileges on a periodic basis and should promptly \nrevoke or amend privileges no longer required by users. Reviews should be performed twice yearly. It is the \nresponsibility of the Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture to ensure that Information Owners \nare provided with the proper reports to review current user access. \n7.6. Remote Access \nProper security controls must be placed around all devices providing remote access capabilities to adequately \nrestrict access to City s network and infrastructure. \n7.6.1. Mobile Computing and Remote Access \nAll mobile devices and removable media that contain confidential information must have full disk encryption \nenabled per the encryption standards laid out in the Information Exchange Management policy. \nPersonal media devices (for example, MP3 players such as iPods) must not be used as peripheral devices on \nCity-issued workstations. \nRemote access is provided by the City as an information conduit to assist in the accomplishment of municipal \nduties and goals. Any other use is strictly prohibited. Requests for remote access must have a valid business \nreason and be approved by Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture and the Information \nAll remote access connections must be through a secure, centrally administered point of entry approved by the \nCity. Authorized remote access connections must be properly configured and secured according to City-\napproved standards including the City s password policy. All remote desktop protocol implementations must be \nauthorized by Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture and the Information Security Office. \nRemote access through unapproved entry points or methods (e.g. pcAnywhere, LogMeIn, GoToMyPC, \nTeamViewer) is not permitted and will be terminated without notice when discovered. \nNon-City owned computer equipment used for remote access must be approved and must also comply with the \nCity s standards. The City will not be responsible for maintenance, repair, upgrades or other support of non-City \nowned computer equipment used to access the City s network and computer resources through remote access \nservices. \nEmployees or contractors who utilize workstations that are shared with individuals who have not signed a \nConfidentiality Agreement with the City must ensure that the City s data is removed or deleted after each use in \naccordance with the policies and standards for disposing confidential information from equipment. \n7.2.3.E. Exceptions: \n Service-Accounts are exempt from password change frequency requirements. Service-Accounts are user \naccounts that are configured for use solely by inter or intra computer or application processes. Only the \nDepartment of Innovation and Technology may authorize their use as part of an approved computer or \napplication system. \n External-Accounts are exempt from the password change frequency requirements. External-Accounts are \ntypically application-level user accounts provided to users to access external services such as web sites.

Such processes include the identification of critical business processes and determination of business \nprocess priority, set forth requirements for development of business continuity plans, adequate recovery strategies, \npotential work-around procedures, and disaster recovery plans. Business continuity and disaster recovery plans include \nprocesses and controls to protect the business, the life and safety of the workforce and customers and to protect the \nimage, reputation, assets, and resources of the organization. \n12.1. Information security Aspects of Business Continuity Management \nCity of Chicago ensures that a business continuity management program is in place that performs regular prioritization \nof business processes and information systems to determine the implications of a lack of system confidentiality, \nintegrity, or availability. Risk-reducing controls and application redundancy should be implemented for those systems \nresulting in unacceptable business losses in the event of downtime. \n12.1.1. Business Continuity Business Impact Analysis \na. A business continuity plan should be executed on a rolling cycle to identify critical business functions, set forth \nrequirements for recovery, and determine overall function priority. Information Security Office assists the \nbusiness units and IT Senior Management to identify critical business functions and subsequently identify key \nsystems supporting those critical functions. The analysis includes identification of threats such as: \nNatural disasters \nFire \nLoss of critical infrastructure services such as power, communications or water \nDeliberate or accidental damage to equipment or data \nSystem failures \nSecurity breaches \nDeliberate or accidental disclosure of confidential or proprietary information \nAnd consider potential impacts of system process outage, including: \nCustomer Member Impacts \nFinancial Implications \nLegal Regulatory Implications \nBroader Reputational Impacts \nThe plan should clearly indicate each critical function s recovery requirements. The plan should clearly define \nrecovery time objectives and minimum acceptable recovery resources for each required supporting system. \nb. The business impact analysis prioritizes business functions based on the business impacts associated with the \ndisruption of the process. Processes should be prioritized into criticality tiers. Tier-1 processes being those that \nhave the least tolerance for outage and highest impact to the organization in the event of incident. Tier-2 \nprocesses being potential dependencies of tier-1 processes, and other important (but not critical) processes of \nPage 2 of 3 \nthe business. Tier 3 and Tier 4 processes represent those processes that may have high business importance, \nhowever, may not be required for operations or have a high tolerance for outage. \n12.1.2. Business Continuity Planning Framework \nWithout a properly documented and tested plan, City of Chicago will be unable to ensure that all business units can re-\nestablish normal and complete business operations in a timely manner. As such, management ensures that each \nbusiness unit develops a business continuity plan consistent with corporate guidelines and allows for the recovery of \nbusiness functions before unacceptable losses are incurred (as defined by the Business Impact Analysis). \na. IT Senior Management partners with business leaders to create a standard framework for all business continuity \nplans. A consistent format should be published and communicated to plan owners. \nb. IT Senior Management ensures that each business unit develops a business continuity plan consistent with \ncorporate guidelines. \nc. IT Senior Management must ensure that business continuity plans have a designated owner. The plan owner is \nresponsible for the maintenance and testing of the plan, developing execution criteria and requirements, and \ndetermining activation status. \nd. An appropriate business leader approves business continuity plans prior to implementation and rollout. The plan \ncontains necessary documentation, have approval by affected business units, and meet necessary requirements, \nas determined by management. \ne. IT Senior Management ensures that business continuity and incident response plans have a training and \neducation schedule and that requirements are set for affected personnel. \nBusiness continuity and incident response plans have a maintenance schedule. Each plan should be reviewed \nannually, at a minimum. \n12.1.3. Developing and Implementing Continuity Plans \nBusiness continuity plans employ appropriate recovery strategies to restore or maintain business operations in the \nrequired time following any interruption of service or disaster through an appropriate combination of business-process \nworkaround procedures, technical redundancy, and disaster recovery planning. Management ensures that business \ncontinuity plans are updated and distributed appropriately. \na. IT Senior Management must ensure that business continuity plans restore or maintain business operations in \nthe required time (as defined by the Business Impact Analysis) following any interruption of service or disaster. \nTherefore, the following elements should be included in the plan: \nFailover conditions or requirements necessary to invoke the plan \nEmergency and operational procedures for essential business processes \nDocumentation of all personnel, systems, resources or assets necessary for recovery \nDocumentation of all roles, responsibilities, and agreements regarding actions during execution of the plan \nincluding internal personnel or any external party agreements \nDocumentation of explicit procedures for restoration of resources (e.g., all major services and systems, manual \nbackup process documentation, logistics and action plans) \nDocumentation of any manual workarounds the business will invoke \nTraining and education schedule for all affected or involved personnel \nTesting and updated schedule for the plan \nRecovery and reporting processes \nb. IT Senior Management ensures that business continuity plans are protected and are considered confidential \ninformation. Plans must be stored securely, and backups must be stored at off-site locations. \nc. IT Senior Management ensures copies of the business continuity plans are distributed appropriately when plans \nare updated. \nd. If alternate temporary locations are used for business continuity planning purposes, security controls are to be \nconsistent with the primary site and approved by Information Security Office. \nPage 3 of 3 \n12.1.4. Testing, Maintaining and Re-Assessing Business Continuity Plans \nBusiness continuity plans should have a documented testing schedule. \na. IT Senior Management ensures that continuity plans have a testing schedule. Business continuity plans considered \ncritical by management will be tested on an annual basis. The process of testing will be determined by \nmanagement, Internal Audit, and the business function owner. This test may include a full execution of the plan \nincluding swap-over of production operations or simulations of the plan to include contingencies and variations. \nb. IT Senior Management ensures that continuity plans for systems supporting tier-1 and tier-2 processes are tested on \nan annual basis at a minimum. Significant changes to the business should alter the continuity plan and be reviewed \nand tested. Tests must be documented, and the results reported to the information owners and any other committee \ndesignated by City of Chicago management. \nc. IT Senior Management and or the owner of the business continuity plan is responsible for coordinating all updates \nto the plan including documentation and procedural updates. This includes: \nCurrent location contact information for all parties relevant to the plan \nAll procedures or processes necessary for execution of the plan \nAll third-party agreements, as applicable \nAll asset inventories or requirements for the plan \nAll training, awareness, and education materials for participants \nDocumentation on security and controls requirements \nPolicy 13 \nCompliance \nCity of Chicago ( City ) employees, contractors and associated business processes are to fully comply with Information \nSecurity and Technology Policies in addition to any other City, Department, Internal, Legal or Industry-specific regulatory \nrequirements applicable to City of Chicago \nII.

Any resulting compliance information should be restricted to authorized \nindividuals. \nPolicy 14 \nThird Party Security \nCity of Chicago ( City ) often utilizes third parties, contractors and vendors ( third parties ) in support of \ndelivering business and technology related services. When, as a result, these arrangements extend the City s \ninformation technology enterprise or business processes into the third parties computing environments the \nthird parties must abide by City Information Technology and Security policies, as applicable, unless specific \nadditional provisions have been established through contractual agreements. \nThe City of Chicago ensures that contracted third parties apply equal or more stringent controls in managing \nand protecting City of Chicago data shared with them. As such, adequate contracts and due diligence \nprocesses protecting the City of Chicago, its constituents and its members must be in place. In addition, \ninformation shared with third parties should be limited to the minimum amount necessary in order to complete \nthe contracted task. \n14.1. External Parties \nRisk identification steps take place to determine and ensure understanding of the risks associated with specific third \nparties. Standard contractual language exists specifically to ensure that third party vendors place the same or more \nrigorous controls around City of Chicago information systems and data. \n14.1.1. Identification of Risks Related to External Parties \nInbound and outbound connections to external parties should be managed to ensure adequate security controls are in \nplace. Additionally, appropriate risk assessment activities should take place for all inbound and outbound connections to \nWhere there is a business need for a direct connection between City of Chicago and a third-party network, \nInformation Security Office should be involved to determine security implications and control requirements. \nAn adequate control strategy must be agreed upon and defined in a contract with the third party. \nThe Technical Operations and Enterprise Network Architecture team ensures that inbound connections from external \norganizations are limited to specific hosts and specific applications on those hosts. If possible, each specific host \nand application are to be physically or logically segmented from production networks. External parties are not to be \ngranted unlimited access to City of Chicago computers or networks. \nThe HR Department and the Business Owner representative responsible for the contract ensure that contingent \nand third-party personnel sign a Non-Disclosure agreement including a statement indicating that they understand \nthe importance of information security. For third party service providers, a blanket confidentiality agreement must \nbe signed and retained. The Business Owner representative responsible for the contract ensures that vendors \nsign Non-Disclosure and or Confidentiality Agreements. \nThe Information Security Office ensures that third party personnel who require access to information resources \nhave a manager sponsoring them. Access will not be granted until formal authorization is obtained from the \nsponsor. \nThe Information Security Office sets a minimum requirement that third party service providers adhere to the same \naccess restrictions as internal users. Access to information should be limited according to the principle of least \nprivilege. Access restrictions include both physical access to the City of Chicago facilities and logical access to its \ninformation systems. \nThe Information Security Office ensures that vendors requiring remote access to City of Chicago information \nsystems have access based on the principle of least privilege. Access must be disabled until they are required for \nuse and disabled after they are no longer needed. If a vendor requires access for maintenance purposes, any \nopened ports should be disabled upon completion of service. Business Owners are responsible for providing \nnotification when access is no longer needed. \ng. \nThe Information Security Office maintains a program to monitor service providers PCI DSS compliance status. As a \ncomponent of this program, a list of current third-party vendors and their specific roles is to be maintained. \n14.1.2. Addressing Security in Third Party Agreements \nContracts with a contractor, vendor or third-party, where there is the potential that City of Chicago owned or managed \ndata will be transmitted to or held by such entity, include information security specific provisions that meet or exceed City \nof Chicago Policies and Standards. \na.

Social Media and Internet Postings \nCity of Chicago ( City ) employees, contractors, business partners and all other third-parties are \nprohibited from making statements or comments intended to be perceived as official statements by the \nCity, a Department or any elected official without prior authorization from the Chief Operating Officer \n(COO), the Mayor s Press Office (MPO), a Department Commissioner, Public Information Officer (PIO) \nor authorized designee. \n15.1.

Some examples of these on-\nline channels include but are not limited to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Blogs, Wikipedia, \nYouTube and any other site where text, documents or multimedia files can be posted. As these \nsites are also often used by our employees and contractors for personal reasons, it is essential \nthat all personal and official business postings be clearly differentiated.

After securing commissioner \napproval, the Mayor s Press Office (MPO) must then approve the account and add it to its list of social \nmedia sites utilized by the City. The Mayor s Press Office (MPO) and the Department of Assets, \nInnovation and Systems (AIS) maintain an inventory of social media sites used by City departments, \nincluding login credentials. \nb. The PIO will be in charge of posting content and monitoring the social media site. Any comments \nposted by City employees should be considered part of the public record and should focus on \nhighlighting and explaining the department s mission and should not contain any sensitive, personal, \nor confidential employee information. \n15.1.3.

Any posts that violate Community and Posting Guidelines must be saved, archived and then deleted. \nd. The following Community and Posting Guidelines must be posted on City managed social media sites. \nChanges to this language must be approved by the Mayor s Press Office and the Department of Law. \n This is an open, productive forum for discussion. All opinions are welcome and respectful dialogue is \nencouraged. Please be respectful of the community as you interact and help ensure that replies to posts \nare on-topic. No graphic, obscene, explicit or racial comments, hateful or defamatory submissions, or \npersonal attacks will be permitted. Users should not spam the page with duplicative posts. The City has \nthe right to delete posts and block users that violate these guidelines. Also, any links, mentions or \ninteractions with users on this site do not constitute official endorsement by Mayor Emanuel, the \nMayor s Office or staff. Please be aware that you participate at your own risk and assume personal \nresponsibility for your comments, your username and any information provided. \n15.2. Prohibited Communications Community and Posting Guidelines \nAll City of Chicago employees must adhere to all laws, City ordinances, policies, and rules when \nparticipating in social media. All City s Ethics rules, Acceptable Use of Assets, Codes of Conduct, \nPersonnel Rules and any other regulations governing the conduct of city employees apply equally to all \nsocial media postings. \nNo user (City or otherwise) may post, mail, display, or otherwise transmit in any manner any content, \ncommunication, or information that can be deemed offensive, a personal attack or violates an \nestablished internal code, rule or law.

Data Protection and Privacy \nDue to the evolution of mobile devices, the end-user must apply the same code of conduct to usage of \nboth City-owned and personal mobile devices. As mobile devices may contain features such as cameras \nand automatic location geotagging, it is imperative that end-users within the City of Chicago adhere to the \nInformation Security Office standards and controls of Data Security and Privacy. \n15.3.1. Reproduction and Distribution of Images \na. City of Chicago employees not enabled to work with and for the City s official social media accounts are \nforbidden to post photographs and videos of interior working spaces of the City of Chicago to any social \nmedia platforms.

Social Media Data Hosting Prohibition \nMany social media platforms, in addition to hosting photographs and videos, are able to store \ndocuments. The afore-mentioned data is contained indefinitely in almost all social media platforms; \nusually removed only if the user removes the data they have posted. Thus, social media platforms do not \nhave a time limit for the storage of user-added data; even time-sensitive stories featured on certain \nsocial media sites are replicated and allow for retrieval of legacy postings in a search by the user. Due to \nthe indefinite time periods for data hosting of social media platforms, it is mandatory that City of Chicago \ndata, including images and files, cannot be stored on social media platforms. The data storage options of \nthe City of Chicago, including OneDrive and local network folders, must always be used to store City of \nChicago data. \nAny exception to the policy must be submitted through a Policy Exception form for review and approval \nby the Information Security Office in advance. \n16.
