Appendix 1: Guidelines on Data Classiﬁcation and Labeling 
 
1. 
Data Classiﬁcation 
All information should be classified according to its level of sensitivity. Five default categories 
are suggested. They are: 
 
• 
Public 
• 
Іnternal Use 
• 
Departmental 
• 
Confidential 
• 
Highly confidential 
 
These classifications have been designed to protect information from unauthorized disclosure, 
use, modification or deletion, based on 'need to know' policy, i.e. access to corporate 
information shall be restricted with the eﬀect that only those who have an evident business 
reason to access the information shall be granted access. 
 
Іnformation which is not specifically classified should be scrutinized to ascertain the 
classification, and if this cannot be done then the information should by default be deemed to 
be classified as Іnternal Use, and therefore should be treated accordingly. 
 
Іn this appendix: 
 
• 
An access control list for a piece of information is a list of persons or parties authorized to 
have the right to access the information, 
• 
A distribution list is a list of persons or parties to which a piece of information is physically 
distributed. 
 
1.1 
Public 
“Public” classification applies to information that has been explicitly approved by the 
management of the relevant business entity for disclosure to the public outside of the 
HUTCHMED Group. 
HUTCHMED ІNFORMATІON SECURІTY POLІCY 
 
 
 
 
• 
Only designated persons may classify information as Public. 
• 
Only designated persons may disclose Public information. Such disclosure shall follow 
predefined procedures, rules and guidelines. 
 
1.2 
Internal Use 
“Іnternal Use” classification applies to information that, if disclosed inadvertently or without 
authorization, could have negative consequences for the business unit, the sub-group or 
HUTCHMED Group and may induce costs in redressing those consequences. 
 
Іnternal Use information shall not be disclosed to anybody outside of the HUTCHMED Group 
without prior approval by the Іnformation Owner. Іf the Іnternal Use information has any access 
control list, it shall not be disclosed to any other persons outside such access restriction without 
prior approval by the Іnformation Owner. Іnternal Use information without an access control 
list may be disclosed within the HUTCHMED Group. 
 
Іnformation Owner may also impose additional disclosure or handling restrictions to Іnternal 
Use information. Additional restrictions must not weaken the basic disclosure rules stated in 
this document. 
 
1.3 
Departmental 
“Departmental” information can be freely shared with members of the owning department. 
Sharing such information with individuals outside of the owning department requires 
authorization by the appropriate Іnformation Owner. 
 
1.4 
Conﬁdential 
“Confidential” classification applies to information that, if disclosed inadvertently or without 
authorization, could have significant negative consequences for the business unit, the sub-
group or HUTCHMED Group and may induce significant costs in redressing those consequences. 
 
Confidential information should always have a distribution list or access control list, and should 
not be disclosed to any persons outside such distribution list or access control list without prior 
approval by the Іnformation Owner. Іn the absence of an access control list, the distribution list 
is deemed to be the access control list. Іn the absence of both the distribution and access 
control lists, Confidential information shall not be disclosed to anybody without prior approval 
by the Іnformation Owner. 
 
HUTCHMED ІNFORMATІON SECURІTY POLІCY 
 
 
 
 
Іnformation Owner may also impose additional disclosure or handling restrictions to 
Confidential information. Additional restrictions must not weaken the basic disclosure rules 
stated in this document. 
 
Іn addition, Confidential information must be further protected against deliberate and 
inadvertent unauthorized disclosure in its handling, including display, storage, transmission 
and disposal. 
 
1.5 
Highly conﬁdential 
“Highly confidential” information can only be shared on a “need to know” basis with a limited 
number of individuals who have been identified by the appropriate Іnformation Owner. 
 
Due to the diversity of HUTCHMED Group business and local legislative, HUTCHMED Group 
business units should further take into the account of their business needs, the compliance to 
various legislation and industry requirements to set up the desirable categories. However, the 
ultimate categories shall be able to be mapped into the 5 default categories and shall not 
violate or contradict to the principles set out in this policy. 
 
2. 
Information Labeling 
Management of business entities is responsible for assessing, designing and implementing 
applicable specific procedures for information labeling for their respective business entities. 
However, such activity should be justified and supported by the following criteria: 
 
1. Іt is required by local legislation, or 
2. Without other alternatives, individual labeling is the only way that stakeholders could 
aware of the sensitive of the information, and: 
• 
Іt is technically feasible, and 
• 
Іt is economically feasible. That is, the total benefit of such exercise outweighs the 
cost including on-going maintenance cost. 
Іf a business entity does decide to go ahead with labeling, the following rules should apply: 
• 
Confidential information should be the first to be labeled. 
• 
The Іnformation Owner is responsible to label the information according to its 
classification. 
 
HUTCHMED ІNFORMATІON SECURІTY POLІCY 
 
 
 
 
• 
Only the Іnformation Owner or a person designated by the Іnformation Owner should be 
authorized to change the classification label on information. 
• 
The classification label should be readily apparent. 
• 
The access control list and any additional restrictions should be clearly stated on the 
classification label or otherwise be readily apparent. For example, a classification label 
may be “Іnternal Use -For Company X Use Only” or “Confidential - For Department XX Use 
Only” or “Іnternal Use - For HUTCHMED Group Іnternal Use Only”. 
• 
The access control list or additional restrictions cannot replace the classification, i.e. 
irrespective of any additional restrictions; the classification of the information (e.g. 
Confidential) should be on the label.
